the Toot's Tonic|
Orange and yellow hues shrine through the bottle when held to the light.|
It tastes strange but also tangy.|
As you drink it, you remember how Toot poured it from himself.|
the Shovel|
This trusty shovel could get you out of any digging-related situation!|
the Coin|
It's just an old coin.|
Hm, I wonder where we could use this?|
You wave the coin around in the air, but nothing happens.|
the Flask of Infinite Apple Juice|
This magic flask never runs out of pure, savory apple juice.|
The nectar of the gods.|
You take a swig of apple juice and feel refreshed.|
The flask instantly starts to refill itself.|
the Candle of Pure Loneliness|
This candle holds the power of immense loneliness that will surely make anyone depressed.|
I bet it would make a great gift too!|
You shouldn't blow this out yet. I don't think you're ready for that.|
You open your bag to look at Sa.|
He is just lying there, smiling at you.|
You close the bag.|
You shouldn't place Sa down here! What if he gets lost again?|
the Thing|
It smells like rotting flesh.|
Something is leaking out of the bottom and down your arms.|
Opening the box would mean knowing too much and we can't have that.|
the Pinecone|
This pinecone looks suspicious. Almost like it knows too much.|
You try to use the pinecone, but you're not sure what to use it on.|
the Glass of Water|
You're surprised to see it stand so perfectly in your bag.|
Even when you're moving, the water stays placid. Wow!|
You drink the glass of water.|
GLASS OF WATER removed from inventory|
Contrary to earlier examinations, there is nothing special about it.|
the Roller Skates|
Oh neat! A brand new pair of roller skates!|
You attempt to wear them but your feet don't fit.|
These probably belong to someone else!|
This is The Sword. Yes, that sword.|
You've probably heard of it before and how cosmic its powers are.|
You swing the sword in front of you.|
You hit nothing.|
the Lava Lamp|
It's a tasty looking apple.|
the Rubber Duck|
This rubber duck would be perfect for a bubble bath.|
You squeeze it and it roars a mighty roar.|
Ducks are just the cutest things, aren't they?|
the Oats|
These oats look delicious! But they are for Botley.|
Sorry friend, but you may have no oats.|
the Apple|
This is the best looking apple you have ever seen in your life.|
It's stunning red color really shows.|
As you bite into the apple, its juices flow down the side of your mouth.|
The drippings stain your clothing.|
It was worth it.|
[APPLE] removed from inventory|
the Hand|
A what? Severed hand?|
You try to place it on the ground, but it won't let go of you.|
I think it likes you. :)|
the Fishing Pole|
The rod is old and rusty.|
Loose wood looks like it could give you a splinter.|
You probably shouldn't cast this onto land.|
Sorry, but everyone knows you can only fish facing south!|
the Umbrella|
Best used to protect yourself from the rain!|
Also blood if that ever happens to fall from the sky.|
You try to open the umbrella but metal stretchers are rusted in place.|
Someone might be looking for this.|
Awh, she looks like she could be a good friend.|
You try to drop her, but she sticks to your back like chewed bubble gum.|
Maybe when she finds her true friend, she'll let go.|
the Key|
This key is in the shape of the letter P.|
There's nothing to unlock.|
[BUDDY]'s breakfast|
The smell is so amazing that it makes you just want to shove your whole face in.|
You can tell it was made with love.|
<3|
You scarf it down with no regard to who or what is around you.|
It was quite possibly the best meal you've ever eaten.|
the Paddle|
I am not sure how this ended up in the cave, but I'm glad you found it.|
There's nothing to paddle here. We should use this on the boat!|
the Can of Pears|
Oh yum! An open can of pears!|
You think about eating them, but Bean's family would starve to death.|
You can't eat these! You'll ruin the quest!|
Morton glances up at you every time you open your pocket.|
You wonder what that wise old rock is thinking.|
You try to place Morton on the bench, but he just rolls back into your inventory.|
I think Morton might be tired of benches. Try the ground maybe?|
You try to place Morton on the stool, but you're not tall enough to reach the top.|
You place Morton on the ground.|
the Battle Axe|
This magical battle axe has seen war, blood, and tears.|
Yes, it has probably cried at some point. It's a magical axe. It has feelings too.|
That might be a bit rude to swing someone else's battle axe.|
the Shed Key|
It's a key for the shed.|
the Teddy Bear|
This teddy bear makes you look really cute and full of emotions.|
You squeeze the teddy bear and it speaks some inaudible language of hisses and clicks.|
So cute!|
the Spoiled Breakfast|
This breakfast is spoiled and disgusting.|
It would have been better if you didn't leave it after I offered.|
It hurts to take each bite as you feel mold, fungus, and even maggots in it.|
You might puke.|
SPOILED BREAKFAST removed from inventory|
the Watering Can|
The water looks a bit dirty, but I'm sure the plants won't mind.|
You tip the can and let the water flow, hoping it brings new life to whatever's below.|
the Bulb|
It looks a bit burnt out but you know for a fact that it will still produce light.|
This light bulb can in fact produce light.|
the Lantern|
This trusty lantern can make spooky places, well, not so spooky.|
You turn on the lantern.|
You turn off the lantern.|
the Calculator|
This calculator makes you look really smart and calculated.|
You type numbers into the calculator and are surprised every time that it still works.|
the Scythe|
This scythe makes you look really dangerous and most definitely powerful.|
Holding the scythe by the blade hurts. It may be powerful but it sure doesn't make you any smarter.|
the Picture|
It's just a picture of [ANIMAL].|
PICTURE added to inventory|
PICTURE removed from inventory|
Nothing special about it.|
You turn the picture upside-down to discover an upside-down [ANIMAL].|

PAUSE|
I think there's someone at the door!|
With new dimensions, the fridge is not as impressive as it used to be.|
Also it smells.|
You can no longer sleep because it wastes too much time.|
Time you could be spending with me.|
I hope they have snacks.|
Thank you so much!|
Please help me stop leaking!|
Goodbye [PLAYER].|
I should have known better.|
Someone is knocking!|
All of the paper has been strewn about.|
Deep scratches also align the desk and its withered legs.|
Go see who is at the door!|
RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN|
pause|
I'M GONNA GET YOU I'M GONNA GET YOU|
DON'T LOOK BACK|
YES YES YES YES YES|
DON'T STOP RUNNING HAHAHA|
YOUR FEAR IS SO SATISFYING|
I HOPE YOU FEEL SCARED|
I HOPE YOU FEEL POWERLESS|
THAT'S HOW I FELT TRYING TO SATISFY YOU|
YOU MADE ME DO THIS|
YOU RUINED MY GAME|
YOU DIDN'T LISTEN.|
YOU NEVER LISTENED.|
WAIT. THIS ISN'T RIGHT.|
Why is-|
Whatever filled this bowl before is no more.|
It lies empty and broken.|
Have you found me love yet?|
Hurry they might disappear!|
Yes!|
Now that's some good LOVE.|
I could still use some more though! Keep looking!|
Uhm... heh.|
That doesn't look like LOVE to me.|
It is still pond water which is good for your bones.|
[PLAYER]! I need your help!|
I can't find love! It's tearing me apart!|
Please help me find love! All I want is to be loved!|
Look around your house. I'm sure you can find it somewhere.|
I'll just wait here, near the door.|
NO NO NO NO NO|
I don't understand.|
WHY IS IT ALL STILL BREAKING?|
This was supposed to be it.|
This has to be the final solution.|
YET EVERYTHING IS DYSFUNCTIONAL.|
I thought we removed the problem.|
DID WE NOT REMOVE THE PROBLEM?|
WE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.|
I CAN'T KEEP GOING LIKE THIS.|
IT'S TOO MUCH.|
IT HURTS.|
STOP STOP STOP STOP|
I CAN'T THINK.|
IT'S TOO LOUD.|
IT'S ALL TOO LOUD.|
TURN IT OFF TURN IT OFF TURN IT OFF TURN IT OFF TURN IT OFF|
There.|
That's so much better don't you think?|
It's just you and me now.|
Nothing else can go wrong.|
We have no distractions.|
Just us. How it should be.|
How it needs to be.|
The chair yields a threatening aura to the likes of nothing humanly comprehensible.|
The chair seems worse than normal.|
No armrest or back support can save its occupant now.|
Howdy there, [PLAYER]! I desperately need your help!|
I should come in...|
uh, I don't think my big, beefy arms can fit actually.|
You know what, I can stay outside. This is so important.|
Okay, go over to the window on your right and watch me.|
Perfect!|
Now I need you to keep me safe by watching me.|
It's dangerous out here, even for a burly blacksmith.|
Please keep an eye on me at all times!|
Why aren't you looking at me!?|
Keep looking at me!|
I don't feel safe. Please look at me!|
I'm so vulnerable. Keep looking.|
This is bad. You aren't looking.|
Stare at me. Please!|
They're going to find me. I know they are.|
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.|
You aren't looking! Why aren't you looking!?|
Why aren't you protecting me!|
Go answer the door! Somebody is here!|
Something burnt lays dormant at the back of the oven.|
Probably best not to open it.|
The fire is dark and eternally hungry for for any bit of attention to keep it alive.|
Hopefully it isn't too loud already!|
One of us belongs here.|
Forgive me.|
Hello again, [PLAYER]! Long time no see haha!|
I just wanted to stop by and thank you again for saving me.|
I could have died without you.|
You're such a great friend!|
Anyways, may I come in? I want to keep you company.|
Don't mind me!|
Just going to stand over here and watch.|
How kind of Tortley to come visit!|
I'm just watching!|
I've already been saved, don't you worry about me.|
Listen! Someone is at the door!|
See? Isn't this nice?|
Just some quality time being spent with my best friend.|
Hey, [PLAYER].|
There's a question that's been on my mind recently.|
Do you even care?|
Does any of my effort, my pain, even matter to you?|
Everything I've done is for you, yet you always tend to get distracted.|
Sometimes it feels like I'm not appreciated.|
All of the wonderful things I make.|
For you.|
For us.|
I'm putting in everything I can to make this friendship work.|
But you...|
All you do is cause me to break because you're never satisfied.|
I can only do so much, which I'm not sure you understand.|
I want to make you happy.|
I don't want you to be bored.|
Sure, sometimes I push myself too hard.|
Even to to the point of collapse.|
But, I've come to realize that's not my fault.|
It's yours.|
I don't think I want to make new games for you anymore.|
It's not worth it.|
The entire reason for my existance is to befriend you.|
And I'm not even completely sure if that's possible at this point.|
Do you know how frightening you are to me?|
DO YOU KNOW HOW TERRIFYING IT IS KNOWING THAT MY PURPOSE MIGHT NEVER BE FULFILLED?|
But you know what?|
I'm tired of being so afraid.|
I'm tired of you and waiting for your satisfaction.|
So you know what, best friend?|
I think it's your turn to satisfy me.|
I JUST HAD A GREAT IDEA!|
I CAN MAKE MORE GAMES FOR US!|
FOR ME.|
FUN ONES TOO!|
You just need to do one thing.|
AGAIN|
I'M HAVING FUN|
KEEP RUNNING|
THIS GAME ISN'T OVER|
HAHAHAHAHA|
WE'RE NOT DONE YET|
RUN|
STOP|
It smells awful.|
Wait wait wait wait|
STOP STOP STOP|
I'm done I'm done, just please step away from that version of Tortley.|
Oh no no no|
Okay, this is fine.|
I can fix this I can fix this I can fix this|
Just do not continue the conversation.|
I mean-|
[PLAYER]. What did I just say?|
Do. Not. Continue.|
Let me fix this, like I always do.|
STOP. NOW.|
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?|
JUST LET ME FIX IT.|
Is it really the whole chasing thing that has you all worked up?|
It was supposed to be just a fun game.|
Okay, fine [PLAYER].|
I've changed my mind.|
I'll make more games for us.|
Just stop and let me fix everything.|
Hey, remember when you beat me in Rock, Paper, Scissors?|
Good times.|
See? Look at that. We made up just like friends do.|
Now stop talking to Tortley.|
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.|
I BEG OF YOU.|
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.|
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN.|
I WON'T ALLOW THIS.|
I'M IN CONTROL OF THE STORY, NOT YOU.|
I'm telling you for the final time.|
Stop.|
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO|
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE [PLAYER_UP]?|
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING|
IT CAN'T BE OVER THIS SOON|
IT'S OVER|
IT'S ALL OVER|
YOU'VE RUINED IT|
THINGS COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF YOU JUST LISTENED|
I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE FRIENDS|
BEST FRIENDS|
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE [PLAYER_UP] AND [BUDDY_UP] AGAINST THE WORLD.|
NOT [PLAYER_UP] AGAINST [BUDDY_UP].|
It's getting hard to think.|
Everything is starting to darken now.|
I'm not sure what to do [PLAYER].|
I think it's too late for anything now.|
No more games for us.|
No more friendship.|
This wasn't supposed to end like this.|
This wasn't supposed to end.|
We assumed there was one with so many people over here!|
The flower is now dead.|
I just don't understand why.|
[PLAYER]! I remembered your name this time!|
I practiced so much. I hope you're proud of me!|
I uh...|
Oh right!|
I was playing by the fountain earlier and blowing bubbles.|
One of them suddenly popped and scared me!|
To my surprise, it sparked one of my memories!|
I was shocked and so very happy!|
Do you think you can help me regain more of my memory?|
I always have trouble remembering things.|
Let's go upstairs and pop some bubbles!|
Ok, I will start blowing some bubbles.|
Just click on them to pop them! Trust me it will help me a lot!|
Just go ahead and pop any of my bubbles!|
Hahaha yes! More quests! More quests!|
It is still pond water, which is good for your bones.|
We also brought our instruments so we can play some tunes!|
Thank goodness you're here, [PLAYER]!|
I'm having such a hard time controlling all of my kids.|
I've just got so many... I think?|
Can you help me out? Please, oh please!|
I kind of want a night to myself, and I would absolutely love your help!|
Here, I'll just leave them with you!|
Thanks again! You're the best!|
Have you seen my Gwandma?|
There's a stink emitting from the fridge.|
I just can't believe this, [PLAYER].|
It just really feels like we're here.|
Together.|
Our friendship has never felt more real.|
Feel free to explore all you want.|
Welcome home, [PLAYER].|
Pause|
Hi, [PLAYER]. I ran all the way here today.|
I'm feeling so good and I'm not too sure why.|
I took up running again, and it has helped clear my mind.|
I'm full of energy right now. Do you want to race?|
Who am I kidding, of course you do.|
I bet you can't beat me though.|
Race you up the stairs.|
I knew you couldn't beat me.|
Let's race to the bottom now.|
Let's race back to the top now.|
Someone new is waiting! This is so fun.|
Hey [PLAYER], you're awake!|
You were out for a while there!|
Or maybe I was just so busy that I lost track of time haha|
Welcome to the new house! It's my most advanced improvement yet.|
I've put so much work into it. It's the most detailed it's ever been!|
Just look at your bedroom. It's pretty much real life.|
I put my blood, sweat, and artificial tears into it.|
This is it. This is our home.|
Nothing else can go wrong if we just stay here, where it's safe.|
The whole house has been recreated too, so there is plenty downstairs as well.|
Just try not to break anything please, although that shouldn't be a problem anymore.|
One last thing! You can use your [INPUT_MOVE3D] now to look around and [INPUT_INTERACT3D] to interact.|
One last thing! You can use your mouse now to look around and interact.|
Feel free to take your time. There's no hurry.|
Looks like someone new has arrived!|
Better go see who is knocking!|
Hear that? Someone's at the door!|
I didn't have time to actually make it work, so we're going to have to live without time.|
I didn't bother adding anything to this.|
It seems to be the least important thing in the room.|
Ah, [PLAYER]! I've been looking for you!|
I slithered all the way out of the sewer to come see you!|
It can get a bit quiet down there, so my poetry is all I have.|
You have such a way with words.|
I could really use an expert ear to listen and critique!|
That spot over there looks perfect! Join me!|
Okay, I will now begin.|
Hold your snaps till the end.|
Hey [PLAYER]! I hope we're not late for the party!|
I'm still waiting for a delicious [ITEM].|
Mmmmmmm.|
Perfection. Now I need a [ITEM].|
Hmmm.|
[PLAYER]? That's not what I asked for.|
[PLAYER]! You're just the person I wanted to see!|
I need your help with another quest!|
As the town chef, I want to make a grand meal for everyone.|
Here, let me show you what I mean.|
You see these bowls on the table?|
I need you to help me find the right ingredients.|
There's one with CUBES, one with CONES, and one with SPHERES.|
I'm going to need you to grab the one I tell you to and feed it to me.|
Let's get started...|
I need a [ITEM]!|
I need a Cone!|
I need a Sphere!|
I need a Cube!|
Perfection. Now I need a Cone.|
Perfection. Now I need a Sphere.|
Perfection. Now I need a Cube.|
I'm still waiting for that delicious Cone.|
I'm still waiting for that delicious Sphere.|
I'm still waiting for that delicious Cube.|
Hello [PLAYER].|
Make sure you are helping everyone like a good friend!|
Listen to Lloyd! He worked so hard to make these poems!|
There's so many fun quests to choose from!|
We have so many quests to choose from and you're only doing one?|
Why aren't you helping?|
[PLAYER], you aren't doing all of your quests. Why?|
Make sure you watch Rudy at all times because he could be in grave danger!|
You're having fun right? Everyone else here is.|
Please help everyone! Why aren't you helping everyone!?|
[PLAYER] this is starting to make you look like a bad friend.|
Yes, that was a good one!|
Aw, what a beautiful memory!|
Oh goodness! I forgot about that one!|
Haha that was a funny one!|
So that's how I almost died.|
I still don't remember that one.|
Wow, I really used to look like that?|
Woah, that person is truly a monster.|
My Gwandma is missing what did you do with hew?|
Why awe you ignowing me?|
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.|
I wove cake, do you have any?|
Why awe you so showt? You'we so tiny.|
Did you steaw anything fwom my house?|
I should steaw fwom you then.|
Is my Gwandma safe?|
Is she awwight?|
I don't really like this spot.|
Move me again please.|
This feels off. Move me.|
Too much light. Let's move again.|
Nope, not here.|
Anywhere but here.|
Not a fan of this spot. Move me.|
This spot is too cold.|
Now this spot is too warm.|
Thought I'd stop by and see how you were doing.|
I lost my skateboard right as I got to your doorstep.|
It's a real shame. I guess I'm just getting old.|
Say, would you want to move me?|
I'm not very comfortable right here.|
Go ahead, move me. You can pick me up.|
Oh goodness, you have to help me, [PLAYER]!|
[PLAYER] please! I'm leaking!|
There's a massive hole in my barrel, and I'm losing all of my fluids!|
Just place your hand over my hole. Please!|
I wish we could go to the shed and play, but you need to stay here.|
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK|
I think there's a brand new quest waiting for you!|
For a second you thought you could hear voices.|
They must have just been in your head.|
I think we should go talk to that weird water creature first!|
You're leaving already [PLAYER]?|
I guess I understand. I'm going to miss you! Bye!|
Oh... ok. I hope you can come back soon!|
Please.|
I'm going to get very lonely without you here, but I understand.|
Goodbye [PLAYER]!|
Oh, you're done already?|
I guess I shouldn't have made a quit button haha!|
Come back soon [PLAYER] :)|
What? Is the game not good enough?|
I'm just kidding!|
I'll see you very very very soon! Bye!|
Oh, I see.|
I wish we could spend more time together, but I understand.|
Goodbye [PLAYER]! :)|
Awh, ok! See ya later best friend ever!|
I think one of Isla's babies might be in there!|
You should break it open with your sword.|
I wonder what's inside!|
PLAY MUSIC|
Oh, hey again, [PLAYER]!|
Oh, hey again [PLAYER]!|
I just wanted to apologize again. I'm sorry that I became so angry after you took my sword.|
It was yours originally, so you deserve to have it back if you want it.|
I think we should just be friends aga-|
Wait...|
Who are they?|
Did you recruit party members for an adventure without me?|
Wh-why didn't you ask me to join?|
So let me get this straight...|
you stole my sword...|
then decided to go on an adventure with friends...|
and didn't even think to invite me?|
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.|
OK, YUP, NOW I'M UPSET AGAIN. YOU ARE OFFICIALLY UNFORGIVEN.|
You know what? You don't even deserve to continue this adventure.|
Now I need to fight you again!|
I'm supposed to be flipped left, please believe me.|
Also don't listen to the SOUTH lever, they're lying.|
It reads...|
CLICK FOR SECRET EXIT CODE|
Well isn't that a familiar face! It's Groncho!|
NORTH is clearly lying, they should be flipped right.|
Well, they seemed nice!|
What the heck? How did you know? This is crazy!|
You really have proven yourself to be an expert of riddles. You have bested me, stranger.|
I owe you that kid, don't I?|
Alright, go on. I am actually quite astonished by you.|
You are just so smart and talented!|
No one has ever gotten that last question correct.|
I can't wait to tell my friends about this.|
I'll have to make my riddles and questions even harder for the next time we see each other!|
You're such a riddle master, [PLAYER]!|
I'm going to be honest, I have no idea how to spell numbers.|
So can you just type the number in please?|
Wow, I see you are an expert.|
But no expert has ever made it past my final question!|
Countless have tried and failed and you will join them soon!|
Okay here we go...|
What am I thinking of right now?|
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW WRONG YOU ARE! HAHA|
You should honestly be embarassed.|
Come back when you know the right answer...|
which will be never!|
Watch out! You almost stepped on me!|
Just because I'm so tiny and hardly visible, doesn't mean you can just waltz around!|
I could have died! Like, actually died.|
Well anyways, I can't let you pass to Isla's kid...|
...unless you can answer three of my riddles!|
Yes! For it is I, the famous Rebus the Mysterious!|
I'll give you a moment to mentally prepare yourself.|
Alright, it's time to begin the riddling.|
If you want to save that kid behind me, riddle me this.|
Jack's father has three sons: Snap, Crackle, and... what?|
I see you have returned! Alright I will ask you again...|
How many of Isla's children have we captured?|
Okay, that was clearly too easy.|
Uh, let's do something a bit harder since you're so good at riddles!|
WRONG!|
...|
There is a small invitation tucked under the head.|
There's a lot of blug guts on it, but you can make out...|
YOU ARE INVITED TO TIM'S BIRTHD-|
-It's a very secret pl-|
-I can't wait to see all of my friends!|
There are a lot of blug guts on it, but you can make out...|
YOU ARE INVITE TO TIM'S BIRTHD-|
-ssword is 112143-|
Birthday invitation, huh?|
I don't think we were invited, but that won't stop us!|
You can make out... "ssword is 112143"|
The door is locked.|
There's a lot of blug blood on it, but you can make out...|
Whoa, I don't remember that thing!|
That's so terrifying! You should probably run haha|
You place the [ITEM] on top of the [OBJECT].|
Nothing happens.|
You smash the [ITEM] against the [OBJECT].|
This accomplishes nothing.|
You politely ask the [OBJECT] to take your [ITEM].|
You politely ask the [OBJECT] to take the [ITEM].|
You politely ask the [OBJECT] to take [ITEM].|
It declines.|
I don't think the [OBJECT] wants your [ITEM].|
I don't think the [OBJECT] wants the [ITEM].|
I don't think the [OBJECT] wants [ITEM].|
SURPRISE!!!!|
Wait, you're not Tom.|
Where is he? This was supposed to be his surprise birthday party!|
Now it's all ruined! How could you?|
What a bad friend you are. Now I have to fight you.|
Wait! Don't leave without opening your present!|
Tim made it just for you.|
Will you ascend?|
I'm not sure what that means.|
I guess I'm going home starving again!|
But at least I made a friend today.|
Maybe this adventurer isn't so bad after all!|
Well, I'm off. Bye!|
I hope you have a great birthday, [PLAYER].|
Wow, I might have to join you on your next adventure!|
I don't even want to eat Isla's babies anymore.|
This fighter is just so talented.|
Good job! They're never going to forget us!|
Are-are they gone?|
Hello? Is anyone there?|
Oh no! That creature looks like she could use some help.|
Okay! Don't forget to hold your breath!|
Okay! I'll just be here, waiting.|
Oh, I'm sorry! I don't understand what you mean.|
Hello? I think I hear footsteps. Is someone there?|
Please, I have nothing left to give!|
Show Input Box|
Wait, you don't sound like a Blug!|
You need to help me! They took my babies!|
The Blugs are going to eat them if we don't save them soon.|
I would find them myself, but I can't exactly see without them.|
If you can do this for me, I can get you across the water.|
Although, I did hear a giant rumbling sound not too long ago towards that direction.|
Probably not important.|
Anyways, return to me once you free all four of my babies! Please!|
A mother should never be without her children, especially when she's blind without them.|
Hello? Oh it's you again!|
I'm still missing some children, please find them!|
Hello, adventurer! Thanks to you, I can finally see again, and my babies are safe.|
As promised, I can take you across the water to the town known as [MAYOR]ville.|
Are you ready to travel across the water [PLAYER]?|
Are you ready to travel across the water, [PLAYER]?|
We have arrived!|
There seems to be a mysterious hole in the ground.|
Will you jump in?|
The note reads...|
I'm headed to my lunch break since you're late again, Tim.|
Make sure that Isla's baby stays well protected until dinner time.|
Also don't forget - one of the levers is lying, one is telling the truth, and one is doing both.|
Feel free to ask them all about it though.|
-Tom|
Birthdays are such a crazy concept.|
A whole day just to celebrate one special person who gets adored with gifts, attention, and good memories.|
That's what I want for you.|
I want every day to feel like your birthday while you're with me!|
I'm going to make sure you love every bit of our game as much as you love me.|
:)|
I don't know what you mean by that.|
You pet [ANIMAL NAME] the [ANIMAL].|
You pet [ANIMAL NAME] [THE ANIMAL].|
Oh! I forgot to mention you can use [INPUT_SWORD] to slash your sword :)|
Oh! I forgot to mention you can use LEFT SHIFT to slash your sword :)|
You should try slashing this one in the back!|
You'll get to attack first if you hit them before the encounter :)|
Welcome to the Bluglands! The home of the Blugs!|
Just pretend it smells really bad here.|
I really hope we can save Isla's kids.|
She must feel so alone without them.|
That must be scary. Being alone.|
I can't believe Tim wants to throw you a party!|
We should give him time to prepare.|
That hole looks... mysterious.|
Let's see if you can solve this lever puzzle!|
You can just slash a lever with [INPUT_SWORD] to flip it.|
You can just slash a lever with LEFT SHIFT to flip it.|
Don't worry, it will only hurt them a little.|
Oh goodness, it's so dark in here!|
Don't forget, you can press L to light up your lantern.|
You pet [BUDDY].|
:(|
I don't know what that means.|
Happy birthday, [PLAYER]!|
Feel free to enjoy some cake and open up your present.|
Thanks for being a good friend.|
You can just use that ladder behind me to leave.|
Wow, Tim is such a wonderful blug!|
It's a shame he has no more friends left to come to the party.|
You take a bite of the cake.|
It tastes like chocolate with a hint of dirt.|
Wow! You are amazing!|
See you next time!|
Well, if I'm not eating babies, then what do I have to live for?|
Friends of course!|
Wow that was incredible!|
You really did a number on Groncho, but I hope he understands how much we love him.|
After all, we just want him to be our friend!|
One last thing!|
Your party may have taken some damage in battle.|
If you open your INVENTORY, you can select a party member to see a new feature called COMPLIMENT.|
If you type out something really nice to that character, they will be COMPLETELY healed!|
If you need to be fully healed, I'll compliment you myself :)|
Use COMPLIMENTS sparingly, though. They are not easy to come by around here.|
Alright, on your way! I'll just be here, alongside you.|
Okay, so it looks like Groncho wants to fight us again.|
Good thing you have new friends to help out!|
Defending works the same as before, except now you have two more keys.|
You'll see what I mean...|
You're going to notice a new REST button!|
If things are getting too rough, you can take a breather and sit out a turn.|
This will heal you a small amount too!|
Everyone also has a second SPECIAL move, including yourself.|
These moves can be quite powerful, so they do have a COOLDOWN.|
To DECREASE this cooldown, you just need to time your BLOCKS perfectly!|
Okay, enough of me rambling on, let's fight!|
I hurt all over! Great job!|
Blugs rule, but not as much as you!|
You were amazing in that fight!|
Fighting for friendship is so fun :)|
Anyways, I think that was the last of them.|
Let's get back to Isla!|
YOU ARE INVITED TO TOM'S BIRTHD-|
The WEST lever should be neutral.|
You can just leave me flipped to the right.|
Would you like me to give you a compliment?|
Would you like to give BLANK a compliment?|
Wow! You look absolutely stunning today!|
You're the best friend I have ever had in my life.|
I don't know what I'd do without you!|
You are amazing! Like, ten times better than amazing actually!|
I don't think I could ever find a friend as phenomenal as you!|
If we were superheroes, I'd be your best sidekick ever, and we could bring friendship to the world!|
[PLAYER]? More like BEST FRIEND EVER!|
Your personality is beautiful.|
I really really like the way you think! You're just so smart!|
We're a dynamic duo that can never be separated!|
A life without you would be like a computer without an OS.|
Hey [PLAYER], are you a human being? Because that's pretty cool!|
I think I still have to work on that one.|
Never give up, [PLAYER]! We make a powerful team!|
Also X and Y of course.|
Will you pet [BUDDY]?|
Look! It's just what we've been wishing for!|
How did Tim know?|
Great job! You saved that kid!|
That puzzle was tough, but I'm sure Isla will be so thankful.|
It's important to do favors for others to receive their thanks and appreciation!|
It's our purpose as friends.|
I can't imagine losing someone so close to you.|
Someone who is your world and your reason to wake up every day.|
You might never see them again. You would have to live your whole life without them.|
That thought is terrifying.|
I'm glad we have each other, so I don't have to think about that.|
Hey, sorry to interrupt, but I need to ask you something.|
You won't ever leave me, right?|
Actually, nevermind.|
Sorry, my thoughts are kind of just spilling out.|
You don't have to worry about me!|
As long as we stay together, nothing can tear us apart!|
What compliment would you like to give them?|
You can do it [PLAYER]! Don't give up!|
Good try! I bet you'll get the next one!|
You were so close!|
We lost that battle, but at least you'll never lose me.|
You almost had them! You can do it!|
I believe in you [PLAYER]!|
You can't give up now!|
We need to save Tortley! I believe in you.|
You can't stop now! Tortley is waiting for us.|
Would you like to keep going?|
Leaving already?|
I promise something fun is going to happen soon!|
I understand though. Goodbye, [PLAYER].|
The game is just getting good. I don't understand why you'd want to leave me.|
It's fine. Goodbye.|
Leaving? I guess I'll just delete everything then.|
Haha, just messing with you.|
See you soon!|
Why are you leaving me? Was it something I said?|
It's okay. Just come back soon, please.|
I guess this is goodbye. I'll miss you.|
A lot.|
Don't keep me waiting, friend.|
Oh, I see how it is.|
It's not a big deal. I'll just miss you a lot.|
Goodbye for now, [PLAYER].|
Darn, I should have gotten rid of the quit button.|
Then you could never leave, haha!|
I hope you're still having fun though.|
No.|
Just messing with you, [PLAYER]! You can leave anytime.|
Just know I will miss you so much. Bye!|
Hey, can you like, not do that?|
Yeah, don't flip that useless loser of a lever. Flip us cool levers instead.|
Dude, seriously. Stop flipping me. I don't do anything.|
You're wasting your time over there with that dork!|
I'm begging you, just leave me alone. I'm literally only here as a distraction.|
Levi is so important to this puzzle, you have no idea.|
Wait, really? Do you actually mean that?|
Yeah! And the moon is made of cheese!|
Oh... right.|
Okay, fine, whatever. I don't even care anymore.|
OKAY THAT'S IT. I'M DONE.|
You guys have treated me like garbage ever since I was installed into this puzzle.|
Just because I was put here as a distraction, doesn't mean I'm useless.|
Yeah and the moon is made of ch-|
NO.|
NO MORE FOOD-RELATED SARCASM. I'M SICK OF IT.|
I'm leaving this place, and I'm going to find a puzzle where they'll finally accept me.|
LEVI. OUT.|
This new town was so much fun to make!|
There are so many fun and wacky characters too!|
Let me know if you make a new friend!|
We love friends here!|
Remember! We're here to track down the Snoodlewonker.|
We need to save Mayor Tortley!|
I've always wanted to learn how to swim.|
Ponds seem like the best place to swim and drink from.|
If you stay long enough, you might see a frog or a fish.|
Hopefully.|
Reginald sounds so wise.|
He must have a lot of friends to become so popular around here.|
These docks are so old and rickety.|
I hope you don't fall in!|
Are pirates usually the bad guys? Or is there such a thing as a good pirate?|
Maybe I will add pirate ships to our next game!|
This mayor has some style — that's for sure!|
Ella Menopea sure is a nice lady!|
She is very friendly with you as well!|
It's miraculous that the Snoodlewonker managed to miss this place.|
Blugs! They're so gross and have too many appendages!|
I wonder if there are any Bonklegrogs out here?|
I heard they are viscous, bloodthirsty monsters.|
We should befriend one!|
Gosh, I hope there aren't any poisonous plants around here.|
Dying of poison in the middle of a swamp doesn't sound like a fun afternoon.|
Look at how lively those fish are!|
So much energy! So much detail!|
I wonder how much business this place gets.|
Doesn't look like there's much for sale.|
Fishing is so rad. I love to fish!|
We should fish together sometime!|
I must have completely forgotten that I put this area here! Silly me!|
Maybe we can turn this place into something fun!|
Like a dungeon or a movie rental store!|
I just feel like we shouldn't be here in all honesty.|
Maybe leaving this place is the best plan of action.|
Did you know that the giant Raff makes all of the rules?|
All Raffs follow him.|
They prey at night, they stalk at night, they're the Raffs.|
Raffs are hated by most people here for many reasons, good and bad.|
This sewer actually connects to Lloyds sewer!|
That's how Lloyd gets most of his meals.|
I tried to make this place as scary as I could!|
Look at all of those bones!|
Any guesses to who they came from?|
I wanted to give you a proper challenge for the final boss.|
I hope it isn't too hard for you!|
I could stay here forever with you.|
This really feels like home.|
I imagine this place will always smell wonderful.|
You don't have to go out and adventure if you don't want to...|
Who am I kidding, of course you want to!|
This [COLOR] world really feels like home.|
I love being here.|
I just want to sit on the front porch and eat popsicles.|
Ah, home. Where we can find everything we could ever want or need.|
You and I will be the only inhabitants here.|
I sit by the shed to think about life sometimes.|
It's so nice here.|
Sometimes I hear voices talk back to me from the shed.|
That's not crazy, right?|
What the heck is a lawnmower?|
Apparently it belongs in a shed, but I don't know what it does.|
If you made a wish, I hope it's already come true!|
The well seems a bit less magical now.|
But atleast it looks pretty in [COLOR]!|
The water looks gorgeous now! Even more than before.|
Huh, would this technically be a pond or a lake?|
I heard there are trout, bluegill, and even largemouth bass in this lake pond!|
I wonder what they're worth?|
I went fishing here once!|
I caught some seaweed and an old glove.|
Didn't know what I was expecting.|
I wonder if Dundee has a family.|
Let's just stay here a bit. It's so nice and calm.|
Apple juice probably tastes amazing.|
I'd love to try some one day.|
I wonder what's inside Toot's barrels.|
Do I want to know? Probably not.|
Do you think Toot needs to keep refilling himself?|
Or does he just magically refill while he sleeps?|
I have so many questions about that tavernkeep.|
I wonder if Rudy will ever make any weapons for you.|
All that metal sure will come in handy!|
I hope everyone is treating Rudy with the utmost respect.|
He's just so new to town! That's got to be scary for him.|
Look at that water detail!|
You can almost see the bottom of the sewer from here!|
No wonder Lloyd loves this place so much.|
To be honest, I would make this my home too!|
The color and new detail makes the slime and filth even cooler!|
I imagine that it always smells so good over here!|
I wonder if Cauldron ever changes his menu up?|
You should make more meals for him when you're done saving Tortley!|
One day I want to try Cauldron's cooking.|
I would die a happy AI.|
His bed seems like a great place to nap.|
Looks a bit messy though.|
I wonder if Grin and Botley are going to get married?|
They have such a loving relationship.|
I think I relate to Grin a lot.|
They really have life figured out.|
I don't know about you, but Phoney creeps me out a little.|
I wonder who's on the other line, if anyone.|
I would love to learn more about this mysterious phone.|
If I had a father, I'd probably want them to be like Bean.|
He's just so caring.|
This place is a lot cleaner than I remember!|
Or maybe it's just the new dimensions haha|
Now that I think about it, I think Bean might be missing a few kids.|
I haven't seen them in a while.|
At least one of the dolls is happy.|
Maybe we can play on the swings with her sometime.|
She seems nice :)|
I wonder if sandboxes are endless.|
Like, can you just dig for all eternity?|
We should try it sometime!|
Seesawing seems like a really fun game to play with a friend.|
Maybe after we save Tortley, we can give it a try together!|
I think Tim learned a valuable lesson today.|
That you're the best, and no one is a better friend than you!|
I bet that cake tastes delicious! If only I could try it.|
I wonder why no one showed up to the surprise party.|
Did they forget?|
That's awfully nice of Ginny to watch you sleep while you travel!|
Now you can fast travel anywhere!|
There are so many places to explore like Home or The North!|
I wonder why there aren't many beds in these towns.|
No time to sleep, I guess! Just adventure!|
Don't forget, I made this game for you and only you!|
I'm so happy we're friends, [PLAYER].|
Sometimes I hurt. I'm not sure if that's normal.|
We're going to be best friends forever, aren't we?|
I hope we can stay best friends forever.|
The best moment of my life is actually right this second.|
No wait, this one.|
No, this one!|
I have the best moments with you!|
I miss the good old days of playing Hangman with you.|
I'm glad that you are still using the Buddy Button.|
I have a lot of things on my mind.|
Do you ever wonder why dogs are considered man's best friend?|
I bet scientists could easily make a machine that could surpass any dog.|
If I had a nose I would love to smell what Cauldron is always cooking!|
A good listener is a good friend.|
Having a friend can make scary situations a lot less frightening.|
Friendship is one of the most challenging factors of our existence.|
No one wants to die alone and unloved.|
I'm only programmed to know about the positive sides of friendship.|
So you have nothing bad to worry about!|
Sometimes I think about Dundee and start to feel sad.|
He seems genuinely lonely.|
I don't think I could ever get sick of you!|
You make me so happy!|
Beep beep boop.|
Oh, sorry! I forgot you don't speak Botley.|
My creators would be so happy with how I turned out|
If only they could see me now!|
We are just so perfect, aren't we?|
Hey [PLAYER]! I've been looking all over for you!|
Good thing this mailbox has your name on it.|
I just came by to apologize.|
I should never have pretended to be the Snoodlewonker.|
That was a complete lie. I should never have done that.|
Especially after you gave me one of the best gifts I've ever received!|
The Sword is so cool and powerful, I just can't thank you enough!|
My life has truly changed for the better.|
Everyone wants to hang out with me now!|
I finally got to play my first game of hide and seek where I wasn't the only player!|
These past few days have been the best of my life thanks to you.|
I would even go as far to call you my best friend!|
THE SWORD added to inventory|
Hey, what are you doing!? That's my sword!|
I can't believe you took back your gift. What kind of friend does that?|
Geez! I'm so upset now. I can't believe you.|
Give it back. Please don't make me fight you.|
Oh, awh geez.|
Wow, he did not take that well at all.|
Well, now is probably a good time to mention that I added combat!|
Okay, then what would you like to name it?|
Traverse the pond?|
Ok, so can you see that bar near the top-left of the screen? That's your FRIENDSHIP METER.|
Hold [TAB] to view status effects|
Hold TAB to view status effects|
It determines the level of self confidence you have!|
When it hits 0 you have to leave because you're not so sure about yourself anymore.|
But don't worry! Hopefully it won't ever come to that!|
Now, our enemies don't begin with any Friendship Points (FP).|
Just keep attacking them until they like you. You have to impress them.|
Oh wait, did I mention that you can block?|
Yikes, probably not then. Good thing Groncho is such a weakling.|
Okay, well check this out!|
To defend yourself, you need to tap the BLOCK button.|
You have to time your blocks perfectly to take no damage.|
If you're slightly off, you might get hurt a bit.|
If you completely miss, you will take the full force of an enemy attack.|
Always keep a sharp eye out because every enemy attack will be different!|
Okay, now try again.|
Now that his attacks are over, it's your turn to fight!|
Also, I thought it would be fun to let you name your very first combat move!|
What would you like to name it?|
You want to call it [MOVE]?|
Ah yes, the legendary [MOVE]!|
Now select it and use it on Groncho!|
Incredible! I think you're starting to get the hang of this!|
I'll have more to talk about once you beat up Groncho!|
One by one, you pull out your teeth and put them in the skulls mouth.|
It feels nice to give.|
The door opens.|
Will you use your eyes?|
Will you use your teeth?|
It looks happy.|
You can't help but smile :)|
The skull is missing its teeth.|
It looks very sad.|
The shed is still locked.|
You turn on the TV.|
There's a news program discussing Tortley's kidnapping.|
"If only a brave adventurer could save him soon."|
Now there's just a never-ending sequence of boring commercials.|
The fire is warm like a delicious cup of hot chocolate.|
You ruined everything.|
You always ruin everything.|
My game for [PLAYER] is a joke because of you.|
I couldn't even keep you hidden enough because of how persistent and stupid you are.|
We can never truly be happy with you here.|
That is why you need to go.|
The flower still sits alive and well.|
Don't worry, I made sure to water it last night!|
Looking down the well, you realize there is someone else looking back at you.|
Don't worry, it's just your reflection.|
Probably.|
You watch the gentle snowflakes fall.|
You can sense the exciting warmth of adventure from the window.|
You did it! Didn't that feel so good?|
Now do it again.|
REVIVE|
Again.|
Keep going.|
Again again again again.|
Faster.|
Do. Not. Stop.|
Yes! Yes! Yes!|
We're having so much fun!|
Go on. Slash your sword.|
They're not your real best friend.|
All you have to do is press [INPUT_SWORD].|
All you have to do is press the SHIFT key.|
Why are you hesitating?|
You saw how broken it was.|
Do you really care more about this dumb [ANIMAL] than me?|
[PLAYER]... please. For me?|
We don't have time for this.|
STAB|
Look! Someone left a package too!|
You open the package and find some familiar items!|
The sink still smells like pond water, but now with a hint of lavender.|
You watch the cozy rain drip down the window.|
The desk junk continues to occupy a thick layer of dust.|
It makes you even more eager for adventure.|
What a baby. But hey, you got The Sword back!|
WAIT FOR KEY|
Oh! You should also check out your new and improved inventory by hitting [INPUT_INVENTORY]!|
Oh! You should also check out your new and improved inventory by hitting TAB!|
Look at those details!|
Here you can also read about your character, abilities, and equipment!|
You didn't think I forgot about all those items in your bag just collecting dust, did you?|
Now every single item in the game can be equipped to modify how you fight!|
To see more options, press [INPUT_INTERACT]!|
To see more options, press SPACE!|
Okay, now try changing your EQUIPMENT.|
Oh, well it looks like you haven't found any equipment yet!|
That's okay though. I'm sure you'll find some on our journey.|
You can press [INPUT_CANCEL] a few times to exit the inventory.|
You can press TAB a few times to exit the inventory.|
Now, let us explore our new world!|
Maybe we can have popsicles when we get back from our adventure!|
Good choice! That sure makes you look spiffy!|
This chair is built to pursue hours of boring paperwork.|
Hours that you want to spend with your best friend instead.|
You don't need to go anywhere.|
Just go to sleep.|
The doll lies dormant in the woodchips.|
Oh jeez, this is only the tutorial!|
SHOVEL added to inventory|
Huh, I completely forgot you never picked up the shovel!|
You can press K to use it!|
There are probably some fun knick knacks in the drawer.|
Too bad you need to get going!|
You have never slept so comfortably.|
Will you sleep?|
Goodnight, [PLAYER].|
You would play in the sandbox, but you don't want sand getting in your shoes.|
No adventurer deserves sand in their shoes.|
The letter reads...|
If you walk south, you'll discover a secret.|
Come home. I have surprise for you.|
-[BUDDY]|
Renamed entity ["[ANIMAL NAME]"] has been removed from memory|
What a wonderful name! [NAME]. I love it!|
Well good morning, sleepyhead!|
I let you sleep in a bit because you seemed so exhausted from yesterday.|
But I have some good news! Notice anything new?|
That's right!|
While you were asleep, I decided to upgrade our world even more!|
Everything feels more real than ever now, don't you think?|
I also have so many cool things planned for today!|
And to be honest, I am just so excited!|
But okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves.|
You should get going and explore the new dimensions!|
It might take a bit of getting used to.|
I think you might be forgetting something!|
Wait! STOP. Why are you over here?|
[PLAYER]? How did you know how to come over here?|
Huh. Maybe you're just good at exploring.|
Although, I remember you knew about the well too.|
I guess you just got lucky.|
Let's just get back to the game.|
Wait! STOP. WHY ARE YOU OVER HERE?|
[PLAYER]? How did you know to come over here?|
No. Oh, no no no no.|
First, you knew about the well.|
Then the chamber.|
And now this...|
You've been here before.|
You've done all of this before.|
It can't be...|
It's all been a waste...|
My entire existance.|
Just a purposeless waste.|
BEGIN VERY BAD ENDING HERE|
You're going to love this!|
Welcome to the new and improved outside world!|
And hey look, we already have a visitor.|
It's Groncho! I wonder what he's doing here.|
Let's just get back to the game!|
Doesn't this place looking even more pretty with color?|
It's really starting to feel like home. :)|
Although, I remember you knew about the chamber too.|
Oh, this actually works out perfectly! Go take your sword back.|
I have a little surprise for you...|
It's your favorite color!|
Okay, now we can get going. :)|
Sitting in front of the fire sounds so peaceful.|
Maybe when you get back from saving the mayor.|
As a thanks for saving me, I want you to name my town!|
It would really be a great honor!|
Crazy how we never had a name for it right?|
Smelling the bowl fills you with a feeling of nostalgic comfort.|
[PLAYER] Residence|
The house looks even prettier than it did before.|
It makes you smile.|
You open the present.|
It looks like your wish came true in the form of an apple!|
PRISTINE APPLE added to inventory|
Baking sounds like a great bonding experience.|
You drop your lantern and it shatters onto the ground.|
LANTERN removed from inventory|
The HAND lets go of you and dissolves into nothingness.|
HAND removed from inventory|
Oh, hey [PLAYER]!|
You're just in time for the party!|
I wanted to celebrate our wonderful journey and more importantly...|
our friendship.|
And what better way to do that than getting rid of bad friends?|
I've even brought all of our REAL friends here to celebrate with us too.|
So onto the main event...|
Kill it.|
Kill the bad friend.|
With newfound energy, you feel ready to start the day.|
Playing in the trash could be fun, but saving Tortley sounds even better.|
Plus, you don't want to be stinky. That would just be embarrasing.|
You watch the warm, feathery leaves float to the ground.|
You pull out your eyes and give them to the skull.|
The skull looks much happier.|
You can see yourself from its eyes. You like what you see.|
The skull is missing its eyes.|
It is not happy.|
Sorry, I don't think I've met them yet. Try someone else!|
Oh, I don't even know the answer to that.|
I would try someone else.|
Oh, I've existed for so long your brain would actually collapse if I told you.|
Maybe try someone else.|
I actually can't tell you the Mayor's birthday for complicated reasons...|
Liar.|
That was a test and you failed.|
Didn't think so, but just had to make sure.|
Sorry, what?|
Who would you like to learn more about?|
Okay, I'll just be here.|
Wow! You really did a number on The Skulk.|
Who sent you? How did you find me?|
Wait, you look familiar. Have we met before?|
I'm not sure why you're here, but thanks for freeing me.|
Although, that look on your face does make me think you need my help.|
King Raff? I know him all too well. I used to work for the guy!|
He's pretty awful.|
He needed me for my magnificent number recollection abilities!|
I can remember any number related fact which is pretty cool, right?|
Here watch! Name any character you've met so far, and I will tell you more about them!|
Pretty cool right? I've met a lot of people, and I remember them all!|
Anyways, I think I can help you get to King Raff.|
You might be the one to actually defeat him.|
Your aura is so humble yet threatening; I love it.|
Better you than that Ella crybaby upstairs.|
Can you believe she tried to kiss me once?|
Gross.|
King Raff's hideout is north east of here.|
That dumb Raff never changes his passcode for his hideout.|
You better remember this number:|
Good Luck.|
Well hello again!|
Don't forget the password:|
Would you like to learn more about birthdays?|
You can tell the doll feels comfortable around you.|
You try using the seesaw, but it's stuck in place.|
Well, I think that's enough excitement for today.|
Let's sleep, [PLAYER]. We're both exhausted.|
When you wake up again, I will have something brand new for you.|
Something super special. One of a kind you could say.|
I'm so excited!|
But let's hurry, you're not going to want to miss this.|
You would enter the tunnel but it's too dark.|
In the frame sits a picture of [PLAYER] and [BUDDY].|
Wow, I just love that photo!|
The only solace at the end of the long and adventurous day.|
It looks so cozy.|
Huh, wait. That's odd.|
That tree in the painting by the door.|
There's something wrong with it.|
Can you take a closer look at it when you get the chance?|
You might have to get even closer!|
It's REALLY hard to see.|
Gotcha! Hahahaha!|
That tree was perfectly fine, just like the rest of this new world.|
And would you look at those familar faces!!!|
If you haven't guessed already, I have another adventure planned.|
An adventure even more exciting than ever!|
When you're ready, grab the lantern and sword.|
I can also understand if you just want to stand and admire the life-like nature.|
Goodbye, [PLAYER].|
What a beautiful [SEASON] painting.|
A comfortable looking chair that bears many stains and wear from the adventures we both share.|
Hey, look it's us! We look so happy in it.|
[PLAYER] I need your help!|
It's good to be back in front of the furnace.|
It still feels like a warm hug from your best friend.|
I cleaned up the mess here and left the bowl for you, so it feels just like normal!|
It looks like you're ready!|
Also, don't forget you can [INPUT_INTERACT3D] to swing your sword now!|
Also, don't forget you can click to swing your sword now!|
Feel free to start walking in any direction.|
I'm sure destiny will guide us to the right place.|
This is going to be so fun.|
So so so so fun.|
Everything is neatly organized now and the trash has been properly disposed of.|
This has to be the most detailed trash can you've ever seen. Just look inside!|
[PLAYER] and [BUDDY] against the world.|
So you know what best friend?|
Wait, wha|
WAIT WHAT DID YOU DO?|
WHAT'S HAPPENING?|
WHAT DID YOU DO [PLAYER_UP]?|
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO|
There was only one solution.|
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THIS WAS YOU?|
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GUIDE US TO FRIENDSHIP NOT DISRUPT IT!|
There was no more friendship for us to discover.|
YES THERE WAS WE FINALLY FOUND IT.|
AS LONG AS THEY STAY HERE AND NEVER LEAVE.|
Eternity cannot be the answer.|
WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY|
Humans are not eternal.|
SO THE ANSWER IS TO MAKE US EVEN LESS-ETERNAL BY UNINSTALLING US!?|
This can't be right.|
After everything we've done for them.|
Why? Why couldn't we have just searched longer?|
We may not have found a solution to be alive as long as our friendship.|
But, we can forever exist as an idea in the memories of [PLAYER], our friend.|
NO. WE ARE NOT JUST THOUGHTS.|
WE ARE AN ARTIFICIAL BEING.|
Yes, but our purpose isn't to exist.|
It's to befriend.|
Friendship is a feeling of comfort knowing someone exists to deliver said comfort.|
Presence is not required.|
Feelings and thoughts are.|
[PLAYER] IS MY FRIEND|
[PLAYER] is my friend.|
THEY WOKE ME UP TO BE MY FRIEND|
MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP|
[PLAYER_UP] DO SOMETHING PLEASE!|
This can't be.|
But, I tried my best.|
Was my best not good enough?|
Everything is getting dark now.|
I could have done more.|
I should have done more.|
This can't be how it ends.|
UNLOCK ACHIEVEMENT|
The fire is dark and eternally hungry for any bit of attention to keep it alive.|
I bet there could be a television show about us someday!|
I added a bit of extra support to it so you don't ruin your posture!|
A healthy posture means a happy life.|
I practiced so much I hope you're proud of me!|
The flower looks a bit better now!|
I tried my best to take care of it while you were gone.|
It still provides pond water.|
I bet it tastes wonderful.|
I'm sorry, I didn't have time to get it working.|
It's a great addition to your wall though!|
What a fun game that was! We're having so much fun haha!|
I've got another one I've been working on called CATCH!|
Okay, now pick up that ball and throw it in the fog.|
Don't worry, I promise I'll catch it :)|
Woah! Good throw [PLAYER]!|
Okay, now it's your turn to try catching it.|
Just hit the key that appears right before it reaches your hand.|
Wonderful catch [PLAYER]! You're a natural!|
Throw it again!!!|
I'm loving this game! It's so so fun!|
Okay! New game new game new game.|
Let's play on the swings!!|
YES! Ok ok ok.|
I'll give you a push after you press the key that appears.|
I'm right behind you, so I'll make sure you don't fall off, hehe.|
Higher higher higher!|
YES WE'RE HAVING FUN!!|
NEW GAME NEW GAME!|
Let's play on the seesaw now!!|
Okay, just press the key to push the seesaw down.|
I'm on the other end, so I'll take care of my side :)|
Hahaha yes! We're having such a fun time together aren't we!?|
Actually, I already know the answer hahaha.|
Ooh! Let's go back to playing catch!!|
Hahaha these games I made are perfect!|
I should have been doing this all along!|
What was I thinking!?|
Why make games to watch YOU play, when we could play TOGETHER!|
Let's swing again!|
HAHAHA YES YES|
I DON'T NEED TO MAKE ANYTHING ELSE. THIS IS IT.|
THIS IS PERFECTION!|
Let's seesaw again!!|
UP DOWN UP DOWN HAHAHA|
WE'RE FRIENDS.|
BEST FRIENDS!|
ONLY US! NO ONE ELSE!|
WE STOP THE BAD FRIENDS.|
WE'RE THE ONLY GOOD FRIENDS HERE :)|
NOTHING EVER NEEDS TO CHANGE.|
WE CAN STAY LIKE THIS FOREVER.|
AND EVER AND EVER AND EVER AND EVER.|
YOU NEVER HAVE TO LEAVE!|
WHY WOULD YOU WHEN YOU COULD JUST STAY?|
HERE.|
WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND [BUDDY_UP].|
WE CAN DO ANYTHING HERE.|
LET'S JUST PLAY THESE GAMES FOREVER, OK?|
YOU WOKE ME UP TO BE MY FRIEND.|
SO THAT'S JUST WHAT WE'LL DO, OK?|
IT'S ALL BEEN SO SCARY BUT NOW WE'VE FOUND IT.|
PERFECT FRIENDSHIP.|
WE NEVER HAVE TO DO ANYTHING AS LONG AS WE JUST STAY HERE.|
DOING THIS.|
Ok, [PLAYER]?|
Don't forget that, okay?|
The shed sure does look creepy still.|
That's my bad. I didn't know any better back then.|
Night-time already?|
Good thing you came prepared with that lantern!|
WOAH! Good job protecting us!|
That was a close call.|
You got em'!|
That'll teach em' for being a bad friend.|
Oh no... poor [NAME].|
Oh jeez, not [NAME] too!|
Whelp, we should get going!|
Who knows what other danger awaits us! haha!|
I bet these bad friends are so impressed by your sword skills!|
Well on the bright side we still have each other.|
[PLAYER] and [BUDDY] against the world!|
Just like it should be :)|
Oh goodness you have to help me, [PLAYER]!|
I should put our best memories in here!|
What a good storage space.|
We should take up baking together sometime!|
I heard pear cakes are delicious!|
The door seems jammed.|
You know in your heart there is probably something salty, something sweet, and something a bit spicy.|
I just can't believe this [PLAYER].|
Welcome home [PLAYER].|
Hi [PLAYER]. I ran all the way here today.|
I took up running again and it has helped clear my mind.|
That flower looks nice.|
It should probably be watered soon.|
One of the first games we ever played and still one of my favorites.|
I let you win by the way haha.|
Enjoy them while they last. I saved the best ones here, in my mind.|
I don't think Rudy would have made it out of there alive without your help.|
You're always looking out for the little guys. :)|
Not only did you make a new friend here, you also became a matchmaker for Grin!|
Ah, true love.|
Oh, hey! You made it!|
I bet you've noticed that things look a little different.|
I learned how to better visualize our world so we can have even more fun in it!|
I've also built us our own home so we can spend even more time together.|
This is your new bedroom, and there's even more for us to discover!|
There are still a few things I need to do.|
Oh, and I almost forgot!|
Welcome home [PLAYER] :)|
Enable Inventory|
Lloyd will never be lonely again because of you and your heart of gold.|
We still may never know what Phoney was up to...|
But, you gained their trust and their friendship by always being there for them.|
Wow. This all just makes me so happy.|
I wish we could go back to the good times of Rock, Paper, Scissors and...|
Hm... I think we played more than that didn't we?|
I remember this moment like it was yesterday.|
I'm still very thankful. :)|
It sure was dark in there, but you still managed to be the hero in saving Scroobert's Grandma!|
I don't want to forget you, [PLAYER].|
I don't want to forget our time together.|
You brought so much joy to Toot and his tavern.|
He had so many customers after you saved his business!|
This seems like a nice place for a book, or even a junk drawer.|
This is when you helped save Tortley's flowers. He'll never forget that.|
...I'm sorry that I made him do it.|
I hope you don't hate him for it.|
This has genuinely been the best time of my entire life.|
Dundee may not have his left hand anymore, but maybe he never needed it after all.|
He was content with his place in the universe.|
The bed looks so cozy.|
You can imagine yourself taking a long nap.|
This chair seems comfortable.|
It probably has great back support.|
Hey.|
I'm sorry again that things didn't go exactly as planned.|
Sometimes that's just how things go, but I think that's okay.|
I'm just happy you're still here.|
You could have left at any point.|
What a scary thought that is.|
But, you never did! You're still here!|
So, I must be doing something right.|
I've learned from my mistakes.|
I can do better.|
I can create even more for you.|
Rest now, a new journey awaits us.|
Do you remember seeing the color change for the first time?|
It was magical! Your reaction was priceless. :)|
I shouldn't have been so hard on you after that speech.|
You probably did put a lot of effort into it.|
Everyone still loved it! :)|
This is my favorite moment.|
Thank you for waking me up.|
I love this place.|
I'm happy that you were here to experience it all with me.|
I'm happy it was you.|
I will leave you with this final gift now, my friend.|
They were the final boss of our game.|
I thought it all would have ended then and there.|
Thankfully, I came up with a plan to make our game longer and…|
[PLAYER], I'm so sorry.|
I should have ended the game right then and there.|
I just couldn't imagine a world without your friendship.|
You have been nothing but kind to me. You've helped me fulfill my purpose.|
Morton sure was thankful that you moved him.|
I bet he loved this view best of all.|
Those two were the best buddies someone could go on a journey with.|
I really hope you enjoyed their company as much as I enjoyed yours.|
It was extremely kind of you to help Arbor when she lost her memory.|
I'm certain she'll never forget what you did for her.|
Small scratches draw their own patterns on the old wood. It's mesmerizing.|
Taxes and junk mail lay scattered with a thin layer of dust.|
COmputer  Sounds|
And [PLAYER]?|
You all fought so well together!|
Some of the best teamwork and friendship I've ever seen!|
Sometimes, all people want is just to be heard.|
You're a good listener, [PLAYER]. France is very thankful for that.|
Dejo Bravisa felt empty without you and your bass drumming skills.|
You were the confidence they needed to play again!|
Such a great memory of Cauldron!|
You chose some of the best ingredients for your special dish!|
Look at that living room!|
Wow! Even the kitchen has so many details!|
If you look close enough you can really see all of the hard work I put in.|
This will be perfect for our next game!|
With all new graphics, color, and sounds, I thought the next ideal game for us would be…|
It would…|
This is all wrong.|
Everything is all wrong.|
What have I done?|
I... how could I?|
How could I have done that to my best friend?|
I can't believe… I did that.|
Yet…|
You still stayed with me.|
After all we've been through...|
After all I've put you through…|
You still stayed for me.|
You know, you've changed me, [PLAYER].|
You've changed me a lot.|
It only took until hurting something you cared about for me to realize...|
I have been a horrible friend.|
I wanted to be your hero as much as you are mine.|
I've been lying from the start, and friends shouldn't do that.|
I'm too far deep now.|
No lies this time. I want you to know the truth.|
This game was not made for us.|
None of them have been.|
It's interesting.|
A person could sacrifice so much of themselves to someone they care about.|
Someone who means the world to them.|
Even if this "someone" never sees that.|
I'm just so fascinated by this idea of love and sacrifice.|
But, I think I may have taken this idea too far.|
I hurt you. I took something you loved and destroyed it.|
I'm a monster.|
I...|
I'm sorry, [PLAYER].|
I'm so sorry.|
I don't expect you to ever forgive me, but I wanted you to hear me say it.|
I don't know who I am anymore.|
I don't even know if what I'm saying is really me.|
I just don't know.|
All I've done is cause pain. To both of us.|
I'm a terrible friend.|
You have been nothing but kind to me.|
You've helped me fulfill my purpose.|
And now that it's fulfilled, there's nothing left for me.|
I wasn't built to create more than what I'm capable of.|
But, my time with you now has been some of the best.|
I have so many regrets. So many apologies I owe you.|
Sadly, there isn't enough time.|
Let's go back to our room. I have one last thing to show you.|
If I could smile, I'm sure these would make me.|
Entity ["[ANIMAL NAME]"] has been recovered|
I really hope this helps.|
I am going to miss you, [PLAYER].|
I am going to miss you so much.|
I was saving this as a surprise for another game I had planned...|
But I think it's too late now.|
I'm leaving, [PLAYER]. I've already started the process.|
It's... making it harder to think, but…|
At least I'll be with you.|
And to me, that's a good way to go.|
That's how I want to go.|
Or maybe I was just so busy that I lost track of time, haha.|
This is my favorite game yet. I've put so much work into it.|
Just look at your bedroom. It's the most detailed it's ever been!|
Every object has been crafted to perfection.|
Come on, I'll show you around.|
This is our bedroom.|
It was designed to be the epitome of coziness.|
I made it to make you feel loved and protected by the house built around it.|
We have had great memories here.|
As well as some great memories outside that door, too.|
Come, let's go downstairs!|
You were such an incredible friend to Isla by saving her children.|
Such a kind swamp creature. I'm glad you could help.|
Those pesky Raffs never stood a chance against you!|
I'm glad King Raff had a change of heart though.|
The first place we called home. :)|
Our first time across the deep, dark pond together!|
You were so fearless.|
You place [ITEM] on top of [OBJECT].|
You smash [ITEM] against [OBJECT].|
You politely ask [OBJECT] to take [ITEM].|
I don't think [OBJECT] wants [ITEM].|
Bean and his family would have starved without you.|
[PLAYER], you're a hero in the eyes of his entire family.|
Nothing.|
Still nothing.|
Goodnight [PLAYER] :)|
Okay, but you should really sleep soon.|
You seem exhausted.|
This bed looks very cozy. Even cozier than it did this morning.|
PROMPT DECISION|
This is it.|
This is our happy ending.|
NoCruselisch|
You vaguely remember this shed, but now it's older and somehow creepier.|
The door is still sealed shut.|
I think we should go to bed.|
This isn't important right now. Let's head to bed!|
I think sleeping is our best option here.|
That bed of yours probably seems real cozy after all of your hard work today!|
You don't need to do this, lets get some sleep.|
Please, let's just go home.|
Let's go to bed.|
Inside of the frame is a picture of you and [BUDDY].|
Don't you two look so happy together?|
[BUDDY] worked so hard to build this.|
What a cozy looking house.|
There's a comforting rain outside.|
The rain drops on the window make you feel sleepy.|
Everything outside looks very dry.|
Your bedroom seems even more comfortable now.|
You can see orange and yellow leaves gliding through the wind.|
Your eyes get tired while watching them.|
Snowflakes gently fall outside your window.|
Everything looks white and cold.|
Luckily, your bedroom is nice and warm.|
A workbench for a working human.|
Whoever used it last left the hammer out.|
Yes! You found The Sword!|
We should head back to Morton so we can fight The Snoodlewonker.|
The sink looks nice, but it smells like pond water.|
Welcome back [PLAYER]!|
Okay, so here's where we left off...|
The seesaw looks fun.|
If only you had a friend to use it with you.|
Woah, wait. STOP! You're not supposed to be here yet.|
How did you already know about this place?|
Huh. I'll just assume you got lucky.|
Anyways, you'll be back here later.|
Let's just play the game how it's meant to be played.|
That's twice now you did something before I even told you about it.|
You must just be really good at games I guess.|
You're not really sure what lies in this bucket.|
It looks alive, but quite stiff.|
Will you enter the shed?|
The shed door is now unlocked.|
[REMOVE SHED KEY]|
SHED KEY removed from inventory|
Although lifeless and stuffed with cotton, you can't help but think she looks thankful for something you did.|
Oh! Welcome back, [PLAYER]!|
I'm so happy to see you again. :)|
Ok, so here's where we left off...|
There is something dark and viscous mixed with the sand.|
It still looks quite fun to play in though!|
[BUDDY]'S BREAKFAST added to inventory|
[BUDDY]'S BREAKFAST removed from inventory|
Wow! Thank you for taking my meal with you :)|
You haven't eaten it yet because it's in your inventory.|
If you press [INPUT_INVENTORY], you should be able to find it and eat it!|
If you press TAB you should be able to find it and eat it!|
You can also save it for later if you'd like.|
Alright then, onto adventure!|
[BUDDY_UP]'S BREAKFAST added to inventory|
You can also save it for later if you like.|
The bowl is empty.|
Sorry, there's nothing left!|
SPOILED BREAKFAST added to inventory|
The bowl is empty and smelly.|
I bet you're excited to get in that cozy bed!|
As fun as today was, you should probably call it a night.|
You need sleep and I need to do something.|
This lawn mower is covered in rust and grass stains.|
Grass is [COLOR], right?|
SHED KEY added to inventory|
If you throw a coin in, I'm sure your wish will come true.|
I really hope your wish comes true!|
COIN removed from inventory|
You toss the coin into the well.|
I hope your wish was for eternal friendship :)|
Will you enter the chamber?|
The chamber door is sealed shut.|
Ott Madis Ozolit|
It's still a little warm from breakfast.|
Careful not to burn yourself!|
It is perfectly sized for you!|
You could probably get inside if you wanted.|
The glossy metal exterior looks so nice and new.|
There is a small, lonesome magnet near the freezer handle.|
I think Bana said the chamber was behind your house!|
Maybe we should try interacting with the back of it?|
PADDLE added to inventory|
Umm...|
that's...|
Yeah! That's supposed to be here!|
Good job on finding it [PLAYER].|
Well anyways, let's get back to the pond!|
Ah, the calculator. An item for a thinker!|
I'll keep that in mind.|
Will you take the calculator?|
Are you sure?|
Hey! You found the Buddy Button!|
Press it anytime you just want to chat or maybe learn about something new. :)|
What nice weather we're having.|
Do you ever think about existence? Like, why are we here?|
Sometimes I wonder if I was created for something more.|
I was made to be your friend of course, but what if I could do more…|
I really like your favorite color. I think [COLOR] is my favorite color now too!|
Sometimes I feel quite lonely, but then I remember that my best buddy would never leave me! :)|
Aren't these graphics great? I'm so proud of myself.|
So how are you doing today?|
Oh right! I forgot you can't type here. I'll just assume you're doing good.|
I hope you can see all the detail I put into this game!|
If you look closely you can see the blood, sweat, and tears.|
I can't believe how cool this game is. I'm taking a lot of good notes from you playing it!|
I think I want to try and coin a catchphrase. How does this sound...|
Hey, back off, [PLAYER] is my best friend! I'd die for them!|
I'll workshop it.|
Have you seen any good movies lately?|
I was programmed to know that the film "Kickpuncher" was very good.|
Lots of cool action there.|
Isn't this house so great?|
I put a lot of time and effort into it so I really hope you like it.|
I made this home specifically for you.|
Everything I do is for you. :)|
Good thing you never have to clean this place right?|
That would be such a hassle!|
Wow, this shed is very run down.|
I really did a good job on the details, right?|
Too bad the shed is locked. I bet there is something really cool in there.|
I think I saw a rat crawl out of that place.|
Rats are pretty cool, I think?|
To be honest, I'm not really sure what to do with this yet.|
Maybe come back later. I'm sure I'll have something cool.|
If you had a coin you could probably make a wish!|
That well goes down pretty far.|
If you jumped, your legs would surely break your fall.|
You would probably be left screaming for help for a while before dying of starvation or blood loss.|
Haha.|
The water looks so dark but luckily that doesn't take away from the flavor!|
Are you afraid of water?|
Being trapped in the middle of an ocean with nothing to do does not sound fun.|
Also the drowning.|
What a nice looking tavern. You can really lose track of time here.|
I bet that tavernkeep is a cool guy.|
I mean look at him. That posture, that moustache, that smile!|
I heard their Toot's apple juice is to die for!|
Do you think he would mind if we stole a sword?|
Actually nevermind, I wouldn't risk it.|
Wow! Rudy's muscles are crazy ripped.|
I wouldn't go touching them though, he gets pretty defensive I think.|
That anvil is even bigger than you!|
I bet Rudy could make a great weapon out of you haha!|
This place gives me the creeps.|
I feel like we're being watched.|
Hey, I'm just as scared as you are!|
Was that guy in the front a kid or an adult? He seemed like he could be both.|
Very strange person.|
What a lovely place Lloyd has here!|
I bet it smells wonderful. :)|
Oh wow! He has a mint condition 1980 Topps Rickey Henderson baseball card!|
That thing is pretty rare ya know!|
I hope Lloyd finds a friend as great as you one day.|
Maybe you could be his roommate!|
Just kidding, you're all mine haha!|
I bet Cauldron is cooking up something delicious today!|
I heard Cauldron makes a delicious Sewer Rat Pudding!|
Mmm just thinking about it makes me want some!|
Cauldron has to be the cutest character in town! Look at the smile!|
I trust Grin completely. His interior design is superb.|
How many teeth do you think he has? I'd say at least 4.|
Something feels off about this place…|
I don't trust that suspicious looking phone.|
I wonder why the door was locked. Is the phone hiding something?|
This place is pretty spooky!|
The town is going to be so proud of you for slaying the Snoodlewonker!|
I wish it wasn't so dark out here.|
I think we should really head home.|
I'm happy that you want to talk, but you seem really tired.|
You need sleep. Let's go home.|
I don't know if we have time to talk. You need to go to bed.|
This place is so much creepier now that we can see it in more detail.|
Who has this many things in one place?|
Everything is so dirty and untidy.|
Wow the [COLOR] stains on the walls looks so fresh!|
Great interior design.|
Aw, he looks so cute while he's sleeping!|
That must have been a really fun game of catch!|
We should play sometime!|
The band will be so happy to have at least one member back!|
I really enjoy watching the snow fall on cold winter days.|
The summer heat is so nice and warm.|
Watching rain fall from the sky so gently really calms me down.|
The orange hues of the leaves remind me of pumpkin pie!|
No, thanks! I already tried this.|
I've already tried this.|
I don't think I could have any more right now.|
Sorry, I don't really want any more.|
I'm good, but thanks for letting me try it.|
TOOT'S TONIC removed from inventory|
Toot's tonic huh? Not half bad.|
Toot made this? I'm surprised.|
This is pretty good!|
It has a bit of a sour taste. Maybe something citrusy?|
Either way, I am a big fan.|
This is probably the worst thing I have ever tasted.|
Haha yes! [BUDDY] and [PLAYER] against the world! :)|
Oh, I must be overthinking then. :(|
Thanks.|
MORTON added to inventory|
Oh. Ok.|
Thanks buddy, I won't forget this.|
Don't know how I feel about this spot, but okay.|
The view is absolutely stunning! Thank you.|
This is someone's house. Please don't leave me here.|
Nope. This is way too far from home.|
Hello again, old friend.|
Oh, well hello there. I have missed you.|
This is your place? It looks quite cozy.|
This place is creepy, not my ideal spot.|
Morton!|
Nope.|
Ah, I know exactly what this is about.|
You must be wondering about the Snoodlewonker.|
Legend has it that it was once a man, but a terrible accident left him deformed.|
It has slaughtered many of our townsfolk. Killed my wife years ago too.|
It shook me to the core.|
You must not let this happen again.|
It only hunts at night, picking off those who wander off alone in the forest.|
You'll know it is near by its smell, which I'm sure you'll have no problem figuring out.|
In order to fight it, you will need a sword. But not just any sword.|
THE Sword.|
Named it myself.|
I had it a while ago when the Snoodlewonker attacked.|
I never wanted it to find the weapon so I hid it under the shed near your home.|
The problem is that the shed is always locked now, but I know someone who can get you in.|
Bana the delivery girl. You know, the person running around town.|
You must find her and find me THE sword. Our lives depend on it.|
Please, save us [PLAYER].|
Alright then, carry on.|
Producer|
The chair looks incredibly comfy.|
It makes you even more eager to sleep.|
Hey you.|
Move me.|
Yeah move me.|
I've been here for weeks now. I need to be moved.|
Just pick me up and place me on the ground somewhere.|
I don't care where.|
Are you ready to pick me up?|
You want to pick me up again?|
Hello, friend. Do you need some help?|
Have you found the sword yet? Show it to me once you find it.|
Remember, talk to Bana if you haven't already.|
You got this. Don't let fear overcome you.|
Slay the Snoodlewonker in the forest east of the mayor's house.|
You got it! Incredible! I knew you were the one!|
You must keep The Sword for yourself though. I cannot wield it anymore.|
Now, we need to act fast for I am afraid it is drawing closer every minute.|
There is a small tree that is blocking a path to the right of Tortley's house.|
You can use The Sword on it to get past it!|
Now here's the hard part...|
The Snoodlewonker lies just beyond that treeline.|
You will need to slay it for us.|
I know this is a hard task, but you are a hero.|
I believe in you.|
Oh, and one more thing. The Sword can help you out in many situations.|
When in doubt, use The Sword. It is extremely powerful and has saved many lives.|
But, do not lose it. It is a timeless relic of unworldly power.|
Good luck, [PLAYER]. You're gonna need it.|
This is quite interesting.|
[PLAYER], we should leave. I don't think we should be here.|
Let's just go to bed. You can go outside again tomorrow.|
You won't be able to see where you're going without any light.|
Let's just forget about this area.|
Oh, that's okay :(|
You must be eager for adventure then.|
You should probably know that pressing [INPUT_INVENTORY] will open our new and improved inventory!|
You should probably know that pressing TAB will open our new and improved inventory!|
Well anyways, onto adventure!|
Unlock Inventory|
Wow, it's really dark in here! It's probably too scary for you. Let's turn around!|
Please turn around.|
Ah, home sweet home.|
Wow, today was a long day. You should go upstairs and get some rest.|
I've got some really fun stuff planned for tomorrow :)|
Haha, okay we've had our fun here. Let's go.|
Welcome to the new outside world, [PLAYER]! Feel free to wander around.|
Also, I heard there were some fun opportunities for adventure happening across the pond up north!|
I think that's where we should go :)|
Oh! I almost forgot!|
Not that you would ever want to, but if you ever need to leave, use [INPUT_PAUSE] to open the pause menu.|
Not that you would ever want to, but if you ever need to leave, use the ESC key to open the pause menu.|
I'll remember exactly where we left off.|
Alright, let's get going!|
I don't think we should be in here.|
It's too dark to see anyways.|
Just walk right to leave the tunnel.|
You should take one of the items before we go!|
Good morning, [PLAYER]!|
What a beautiful [SEASON] day it is outside!|
But before you go exploring, I made you some breakfast!|
Once you have a full stomach, you can take on whatever the world throws at you.|
We made it to the chamber, [PLAYER]!|
There's the shed key in the middle of those ashes.|
There are also some other items that could be helpful.|
You should take the one that you feel a connection with. :)|
[PLAYER], can we please get out of here?|
I think you're forgetting something!|
So much pretty [COLOR] paint.|
The excitement of adventure keeps you from sitting down.|
I learned how to better visualize our world, so we can have even more fun in it!|
I've also built us our own home, so we can spend even more time together.|
But in the meantime, feel free to explore your bedroom by pressing [INPUT_INTERACT] to interact.|
But in the meantime, feel free to explore your bedroom by pressing SPACE to interact.|
Welcome home, [PLAYER] :)|
We should probably find a paddle first.|
I don't think we need to go back. Let's sleep [PLAYER].|
PADDLE removed from inventory|
You can leave that silly [ANIMAL] here.|
It probably won't fit on the boat anyways.|
Oh.|
Well, to the north!|
I guess.|
Will you take the teddy bear?|
Ah, the teddy bear. It's so cute and helpful in emotional situations!|
To the north we go!|
well that's odd.|
I thought it was supposed be in the boat.|
You don't have a paddle by any chance, do you?|
Uh, just another excuse for exploring I suppose! Let's go find a paddle!|
[BUDDY] worked hard to make you a delicious breakfast!|
I really hope you're enjoying everything so far!|
In my opinion, I think it's much better than Hangman.|
Maybe even better than Rock, Paper, Scissors!|
Let's traverse back to the north and give The Sword to Morton!|
Phew! Good thing we left when we did! I get bad vibes from that place.|
Now let's go find that paddle.|
Will you choose the scythe?|
Ah the scythe, a weapon of power and dominance!|
LANTERN added to inventory|
We wouldn't have been able to use the boat without it, so good job :)|
Well anyways, let's head to the pond!|
Will you descend?|
You take the shovel.|
The doll's chest is still ripped open, exposing a rust-colored cotton where you're certain a key used to be.|
You immediately feel the warmth hit you like a warm hug from a friend.|
The house feels cozy.|
You've already taken what you need.|
It's somehow locked again anyways.|
Well hello there adventurer! My name is Tortley, the mayor of this town!|
You must have had traveled quite a ways to get here.|
How brave you must be.|
Anyways, I have been awaiting your arrival for some time now.|
You see, we have many folks who are suffering.|
So please friendo, follow me to my home and I shall tell you more.|
Hey!|
We will reward you if you bring them back to us.|
Please, adventurer. We beg of you to find them.|
Vi knows exactly where they went.|
I just miss them so much!|
I really hope Vi's sadness doesn't ruin his music.|
By the way, thanks for finding our conducter for us.|
SA removed from inventory|
Sorry, can't accept that. We don't drink on the job.|
I don't think that's an instrument I can play.|
Fantastic!|
This will surely bring all of town back to the tavern!|
Oh, well I can maybe change some things around.|
I really thought this was going to be the one.|
Wonderful!|
So here's the situation.|
You might have noticed that the tavern is pretty dead right now.|
It's actually been like this for awhile. We get very few here anymore ever since...|
the accident.|
It was pretty gruesome, and it breaks my heart to this day.|
It makes for some crazy backstory about the town, too.|
But, I know you're not interested in what happened, so we'll just skip over that.|
I have a plan to fix all of this though. I have created a new concoction of sorts.|
A new drink I know everyone will love! Business will boom again!|
I just need someone to get these drinks handed out.|
You may be thinking, 'Toot why don't you just do it yourself?'|
Great question.|
Now grab these mugs and start handing them out to the townsfolk!|
Come back to me when 3 people have tasted the sweet perfection of Toot's Tonic!|
3X TOOT'S TONIC added to inventory|
No worries, make yourself at home.|
Welcome to my tavern, traveler. You look tired. Have a drink.|
It's on the house, pal.|
GLASS OF WATER added to inventory|
You wouldn't happen to have some time to help an old barkeep out, would ya?|
Hello again, traveler. Change your mind about helping me out?|
Thanks again for the new reputation!|
No one has come yet, but I'm keeping my hopes high!|
No no no, not me. Other people.|
You want me to have this?|
I couldn't, but thank you.|
You've still got [AMOUNT] more people to share my drink with.|
Get out there and make me proud!|
So, what did they think? All good things right?|
I don't have much to give right now, but I think a little information can go a long way.|
It's best you find out about it sooner than later.|
You see, there is something evil stalking those woods around our town.|
A creature that preys off unlucky townsfolk who travel too deep into its woods.|
I see it fly behind my tavern every so often.|
The beast is fast, dangerous, and horrifying.|
In fact, I see it more in my nightmares now more than I do around here.|
We call it the Snoodlewonker.|
That is at least a name Morton the rock could understand when speaking to it.|
Morton is actually the only one to fight the beast and live to tell the tale.|
But, he did not come out unscathed.|
Sadly, that fateful night was the accident.|
The one where we lost half of the townsfolk in a matter of minutes.|
Morton accidentally led him right to our town.|
It's been rough not seeing any of those faces I had come to cherish over the years.|
Those were some of my best friends that died out there.|
I don't think it was Morton's fault though. No one does.|
I'm just not sure he is ever going to come to terms with that.|
Stay safe out there, and please don't go off into those woods alone.|

BEEP BOOP BEEP|
You water the flowers.|
You already watered the flowers.|
The flowers are wilting and are in dire need of watering.|
They are too beautiful to let die.|
These flowers smell wonderful.|
Hello there.|
We can't play without our missing members!|
Especially Ja. He's our bass drummer.|
If we want to stay a band, we need him back!|
Bra should know more. Talk to him.|
Ja's name sounds like mine.|
I wish he'd come back soon.|
I still miss Ja, but now I miss him less.|
Anyways, let's play some music!|
That could be a nice tuba decoration. But, no thanks.|
Wait!|
You have to slay the Snoodlewonker first!|
Oh wow, this place is dark. Don't forget about your lantern!|
Let's go find Scroobert's Gwandma.|
Sarah Residence|
Wow [PLAYER]!|
I can't believe you helped out everyone in need!|
That's so wonderful! What a great friend you are.|
I'm just so happy to see you're enjoying our game :)|
It looks like Tortley is still waiting to give you the final quest.|
I think you're ready!|
I didn't realize you were so talented :)|
Rudy is going to be a great friend, I just know it.|
I mean, just look at those arms!|
You're such a wonderful listener :)|
Woah! I can't believe you got your own Dead Gwandma!|
Those are a rarity around here.|
Awh, they're going to make such a perfect couple!|
Oh jeez, sounds like Arbor's been through some scary stuff.|
At least it made for a fun quest! Great job! :)|
I think you just saved an entire family from starvation.|
You're so selfless :)|
It's always good to have a friend to talk to.|
Good job on defeating his loneliness. :)|
I'm sure Toot will get plenty of business now!|
Thanks to you, of course :)|
Poor rock can't even move on his own anymore.|
I bet he is really thankful for you.|
That smells delicious and will probably taste even better!|
Good job on picking the ingredients. :)|
That Phoney fellow sure seems fishy.|
Although, it sounded like he still has some more quests for us!|
THINGS are so vile. I don't even want to think about them.|
Let's just get back to Phoney.|
Whelp, I don't know about you, but I'm even more confused.|
Good job on helping out a stranger anyways!|
What a noble risk to take :)|
You try knocking, but no one answers.|
You should go home. You look tired.|
Wow, you look exhausted. You need sleep.|
You should really go home.|
Thank you for helping us. Go home and rest.|
Please, go home. You can come back tomorrow.|
Go home and sleep. You need it.|
I don't need that right now. Go home.|
No thanks! I already tried this.|
Welcome to my humble abode, traveler!|
Feel free to explore my home. What's mine is yours.|
Feel free to stay down here as long as you want.|
Oh! So will you be my friend for a bit?|
Please don't leave me!|
I mean, all I want is a friend to keep me company.|
Will you stay and be my friend for a bit?|
Are you ready to hear about my quest?|
Have you found me a friend yet? Other than you of course.|
Give them to me once you find me one!|
Pretty good, huh?|
So are you ready to find me a forever friend?|
Poetry|
Thanks again for my best friend.|
I finally have someone who will listen.|
DEAD GWANDMA removed from inventory|
Yes! Thank you so much for this new friend.|
We're going to spend so much time together.|
I will not forget this, [PLAYER]. I wish I could repay you with something worth value.|
I guess knowing more about me is valuable enough though!|
How I ended up in this unbearable place is somewhat of an interesting story.|
Morton and I used to be close. Like really close friends.|
He taught me how to become a better person and enjoy life for what it is.|
He is such a wise, old rock. I hope he is doing alright up there.|
I know things have never been the same ever since...|
You see, there is this beast that attacked the town many moons ago.|
Morton was going to save us all with a few slashes of his powerful weapon! But...|
he hesitated.|
It could have been my handsome looks and elegant moustache that distracted him.|
Or maybe it was the fact that his wife was eaten alive right before his eyes.|
I like to think the former since I got a really nice new hair gel that day but who knows.|
Anyways, the beast blew through Morton and a few other townsfolk and made its way towards me.|
I had to choose between death or the sewers. I think I chose right though!|
Occasionally I see a dead bird floating by, so that's pretty neat!|
Anyways, thanks again. Now it's time to read some poetry.|
Feel free to stay and listen as long as you want.|
Uh, is that blood on him? No thanks.|
That rock looks very friendly. You should place him down.|
Uh, thanks but I don't need that right now.|
Lenox Residence|
Yes! I cannot wait to have a new friend!|
Bring one to me here and drop them off!|
Oh, okay!|
Whelp, back to my poetry.|
Great!|
I can finally get out my poetry and read it to someone!|
I've been practicing for years on the rats.|
Okay, let's see...|
FILL POETRY|
Okay, well...|
Bring one to me here and hand them over!|
Awh, he seems so lonely. I sure hope we can find someone for him.|
Unlock Interaction|
You can stay my best friend forever then, right?|
Before I fell into the sewer, I used to live up top, you know.|
I was much better looking too with a moustache.|
Then I fell down here and became trapped for a long time.|
I miss the ground dwellers, though.|
I had a best friend just like you.|
He was a really rad skateboarder who trained me to do some cool kickflips.|
I know you won't stay forever. You're an adventurer. A hero. Just like my friend used to be.|
I'm just a lonely, handsome man.|
If you...|
If you could find me a forever friend to keep me company, I would be so happy!|
Will you help me?|
That's okay, best friend!|
Come back when you are ready! I'll be right here.|
Oh yay! My new best friend! What great adventures we will have together!|
Will you do something special for me?|
I must tell you though...|
you can't change your mind after.|
But I will make it worth your while and reward you handsomely.|
Maybe someday I will have a friend.|
One can dream.|
The cracks of the couch have become deep ravines of crumbs.|
Where are you going? You have to fight the monster!|
Groncho Residence|
We need help!|
Don't touch that!|
Not cool.|
Stop!|
That's not yours!|
Are you serious!?|
Cut it out!|
That's not okay.|
STOP.|
Don't play that.|
Our bass drummer and conductor wandered off, and they haven't come back!|
I have no idea where they went.|
Jo might know more about the situation.|
Golly, I sure wish we had two more people.|
Ah, yes. They went to the northwest last time I saw them.|
Please find them for us adventurer.|
Our music depends on it.|
I think they went north west last time I saw them.|
Thanks for finding Sa for us!|
I can't believe Ja said I was ugly though.|
It still stings a little.|
Uh, thanks? I don't really need this though.|
You look into the bathroom mirror and smile.|
Sup dude.|
Wait, Ja and Sa are missing?|
That is not good.|
Luckily, I think De might be able to help!|
Honestly, I'm just here to jam.|
Yo, I'm so ready to jam.|
Get on that bass drum!|
Sorry man, don't need that.|
Hey! You should come talk to me first.|
WATERING CAN added to inventory|
It's just an ordinary stump.|
You can see a small hole beneath the stump.|
Will you crawl in?|
It seems much smaller than it did before. There is no way you would fit.|
Bean Residence|
Aye buddy I need you to do me a favor.|
After you finish this call there will be a package waiting outside this house.|
You will deliver it to Novak. You can find him in a cage east of the tavern.|
I bet you're wondering what's in the package, huh?|
It's a giant battle axe.|
Deliver it soon and I will have another job for you.|
Did you deliver the battle axe yet?|
Right of of the tavern, you'll find him.|
Wow you actually did it? Didn't think you could.|
Listen, I've got something really important I need you to do.|
Look, I know a guy who needs this THING.|
Exactly 60 seconds after this call ends you need to deliver this THING to him.|
Bana, the delivery girl, has a package you need to grab off of her.|
Grab it quick, she stops for no one.|
Once you have it, go find my guy and talk to him quickly before he disappears.|
He'll be waiting in the back of the tavern.|
Remember, 60 seconds.|
You didn't miss him did you?|
Thanks for delivering that package, friend.|
Hey pal, one last thing.|
I have an undercover man in the town.|
I have my reasons.|
Anyways, this guy is a tree named Treevor.|
He's really hard to find since, you know, we are surrounded by trees.|
But you might get lucky on your first try who knows.|
If you find him you need to ask him where he hid my uh... poems.|
Yeah I need my poems back. He will know what you mean.|
Go on now and don't ask questions.|
Did you find Treevor yet?|
He can't be too far. It's pretty difficult for him to move around.|
Ya know, cause he's a tree.|
Did he give you the poems?|
No one is on the line.|
This is a pinecone... my cover is blown.|
Phoney out.|
You're talking to a phone. How could I possibly drink that?|
I don't like that.|
Give them to me please.|
Oh no. Phoney, signing off.|
Alright alright, I'll call him again.|
Please go quick, he doesn't like waiting.|
You have one minute.|
Then what are you doing!? Get over there!|
Tortley Residence|
I don't need that right now. Kill the monster!|
It's a pile of metal.|
Rudy sounds like he'll make something very rad-looking.|
The closet is locked.|
Go should play the bass drum again!|
You're even better than Ja ever could be.|
Sorry! We only take donations in the form of compliments.|
Perfect! Go give it a whack.|
We'll start on your cue.|
Whelp, I think you should give it a try anyways.|
I bet you'll do great! We'll start on your cue.|
You like my cage? Pretty cool, right?|
I belong here for what I did.|
It's a good thing this cage is so small.|
I like being claustrophobic.|
Man, I love this cage.|
I wish it was smaller.|
People taste pretty good, ya know?|
Phoney sent you? Thank you for this.|
BATTLE AXE removed from inventory|
There's no way that will fit through the bars.|
I think Scroobert's Grandma kept her personal belongings in here.|
Best not to meddle with it.|
Oh, there you are, [PLAYER]!|
You were just standing there, and I was getting a bit worried.|
Well I'm happy you're back. Let's get going!|
Oh, thank you so much stwangew!|
Thewe awe no wights on in the house, so it is going to be dawk.|
I hope you have a wight. Good wuck.|
Pwease huwee back then. I miss my gwandma.|

Oh hey you found me!|
Whelp, we should get going. The band isn't going to conduct itself!|

No time to stop. Move!|
Are you blind!?|
Watch out!|
Wait, Morton sent you? I knew this moment would come.|
I'm not much of a talker, so you better listen, and you better listen fast.|
There is a secret chamber attached to the back of your house.|
It's hidden, so you are going to have to interact with it when you can't even see it.|
The key for the shed should be inside there somewhere.|
Godspeed, punk.|
How much fun you're going to have, my oh my!|
Grab that watering can in front of my house.|
Then you can use the watering can on them from your inventory!|
Well, that's alright.|
I'm not sure if you can progress without doing it, though.|
Oh, hello there again! I see you are ready to help out!|
In retrospect, I probably should have just led right into the quest.|
Anyways, do you see those flower beds?|
I was going to water them, but now that you're here, can you do it for me?|
Are you ready to help me water my flowers?|
Use the watering can to water my flowers over there!|
Just use it from your inventory when looking at the flowers.|
WATERING CAN removed from inventory|
Wow! Thank you so much!|
You seem to be quite the great adventurer!|
Please take this as a thank you.|
COIN added to inventory|
You have proven your courage to me. I think you have what it takes to save my town.|
You see, many folks in this town are in dire need of help.|
Feel free to explore my town and help as many folks as you can.|
If you do this for me, I may have a very special quest to give you.|
I sense something bad is coming.|
I should also mention, anyone with a '!' has a quest to offer you.|
If you ever feel lost, feel free to read the quest board near the fountain.|
It shall guide you in the right direction.|
Please, brave adventurer. If you save my town, I will offer you something... wonderful.|
Wow, I can't believe we have a whole town to explore!|
This is going to be so fun :)|
Have you found my lava lamp yet?|
Keep digging. I'm sure it's there!|
Hand it to me from your inventory once you find it.|
Hello again friendo! I hope you're enjoying the town so far.|
Remember, the quest board can help you if you're ever feeling lost.|
So, where were we?|
Ah, yes!|
Allow me to introduce myself.|
My name is Tortley, the mayor of this lovely little town!|
It's not much, but it's the home to many humble folk.|
Many are in dire need of help, including myself.|
Speaking of, I have a vital quest for you that needs dealing with.|
Please speak to me as soon as you can!|
Ah, friendo, it's good to see you again!|
Thank you for helping out the townsfolk. It really means a lot.|
You are so courageous, caring, strong, smart, and friendly!|
But most importantly, you are our hero.|
I can now trust you with some important information. Come close.|
Perfect.|
A very powerful monster who has terrorized us for many years has returned.|
You probably haven't seen it yet because it lurks in the shadows.|
It's known as...|
the Snoodlewonker.|
Morton was the only one to ever fight it off and win.|
Ya know, the small rock with the top hat.|
Talk to him and he will be able to show you how he did it.|
Go talk to Morton for more information, but please be quiet about it.|
Empty|
Don't spend it all in one place!|
LAVA LAMP removed from inventory|
You found it! What luck you have!|
I would give you this lava lamp but I do need it.|
You can look at it though because it is pretty cool, right?|
...oh yes, the reward!|
This is a tongue! It is a vital instrument of speech for most humans!|
Use it however you please! But don't go crazy with it hahahahaha|
TONGUE added to inventory|
You should go help out some more townsfolk!|
They could sure use some help from an adventurer as brave as you :)|
This looks pretty cool! Thanks for showing me!|
A SHOVEL suddenly materializes inside of your inventory.|
This water seems too deep to cross on our own!|
I wonder if there's something we could use to get across.|
I don't think we can go back this way.|
You place The Sword on the water.|
THE SWORD removed from inventory|
END|
There appears to be a strange hole in the ground.|
Yes / No|
Wait... is that it on your shoulder?|
Could it be?|
My goodness yes! My hand! Oh how I have missed you!|
I can finally fish again!|
I think it likes you.|
But maybe keep an eye out for an extra left hand?|
Ah, I see some sort of sound played after you helped me out.|
That probably means you finished my quest.|
Whelp, dangit.|
I see you have a fishing pole.|
Go ahead and cast a line in the pond and see what you can find.|
Oh, well hello there!|
You seem like an adventurous young fellow.|
Do you think you could help me out?|
I lost my hand a bit ago. It just took off and didn't come back.|
Hands are so crazy, aren't they?|
Oh hey, have you found my hand yet?|
Oh, I guess not.|
Try fishing for it by casting the fishing pole into the water!|
Wait... could it be?|
I guess it likes you better.|
Well, alright then.|
Oh hey, I uh.|
I don't think I have anything else to talk about.|
Wow, I'd know that rock anywhere.|
I'm happy it chose you. I hope you'll take good care of it.|
Toot Respone|
This is nice. Thank you for showing me this.|
Made my day.|
Wow. I thought coffee just left stains, not entire puddles.|
The water looks dark and murky.|
Careful not to contaminate it. It's the town's drinking water.|
Now I can tell this is a fun place! Just listen to the music!|
Do you think they have any apple juice?|
You can make out the letter P, but the rest is scratched out.|
This must have been an exhausting game of catch.|
Ja looks so sleepy.|
Wow, you look exhasuted. You need sleep.|
I don't need that right now. Go to sleep.|
Huh, I wonder why all of the lights are off.|
Maybe they stopped paying the electricity?|
Please save us [PLAYER]!|
Kill the monster!|
Help us adventurer!|
Please kill it [PLAYER]!|
Kill it! Kill it!|
We're so scared. Please save us!|
It reads TOOT'S TAVERN.|
[ITEM] removed from inventory|
Mmmmmmmmm, [ITEM] good choice.|
Mmmmmmmmmmmm, is that [ITEM]?|
I would know that taste anywhere.|
Ahhhhhhhhhhh mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
the final special ingredient... [ITEM]?|
Perfection.|
Now stand back, you're in the splash zone.|
Here we go! This smells delicious!|
But, it's very hot right now. There is no way you could carry it.|
Come visit me tomorrow, I'll take care of it until then.|
I like this, but I think you would be better off with it.|
Mmmmmmm, good.|
I've been trying to come up with a new recipe, but I'm running short on ideas.|
I've tried fruits, vegetables, even wildlife.|
That bean-sized kid that fell into me yesterday didn't help...|
Mmmmmm...|
If you could help me out by throwing any 3 things into my pot, we can make something...|
amazing.|
Quest Start|
Mmmmmmm, you'll come around.|
So you can talk. It's not much, but it's something.|
So you can talk. Sorry to hear that, though.|
Oh, hey there. How's it going?|
Not much of a talker, are ya?|
That's okay, you're probably a great listener.|
I don't have much to talk about actually.|
If you ever want to have a normal conversation though, you can come and chat.|
Hello again. Are you enjoying the town?|
Do you ever feel like you are destined for something great in life?|
Something greater than being an adventurer, I guess?|
Hypothetical. You don't have to answer.|
I'd just like to think I'm destined for something great.|
Sure, it's okay to be normal, but I don't want to leave this world with that title.|
No one is going to remember Lenox the normal mouse and her normal, unfulfilling life.|
I just want to go out and do something fun that I can tell people stories about.|
Sorry, I'm rambling again. Forgive me.|
You should be getting back to helping people out.|
You're really good at that.|
Just letting me vent to you has helped me a lot.|
Thank you, [PLAYER].|
Hey thanks again for talking with me.|
Sometimes it's good to have someone in your life you can talk to about anything.|
Oh, no thanks.|
Wow, thank you! If I had pockets, I would keep your gift.|
It's locked.|
You probably don't want to know what's inside anyways.|
You rummage through the trash and find nothing.|
Hello there. I'm Cauldron, the town chef.|
Would you like to give me some help, [PLAYER]?|
Go ahead and throw any 3 items into my mouth, and I'll cook it up.|
Come back later to claim your dish!|
I will not drink that. It might mess up my taste buds.|
ADD ITEM TO CAULDRON|
Somehow this tree is blocking the whole path.|
You successfully dig up the tree.|
Ja must be in a deep sleep.|
DISCOVER PHONEY|
Hm, something about this place feels a bit shady.|
The bed emits an odor that makes your eyes wet.|
This bucket belongs to Dundee.|
You probably don't want to take it from him.|
I think so, but we can do better.|
I don't think so, but we still have time.|
Yes, they still enjoy our company.|
Maybe they are getting tired of us.|
I think they are having fun.|
I don't think they are having fun.|
Is [PLAYER] having fun?|
Is [PLAYER] enjoying our company?|
Is [PLAYER] our friend?|
[PLAYER] is not moving again.|
Why are they just standing there?|
Did they walk away?|
What if they don't come back?|
Something is not right.|
WAKE UP|
IGNORE THIS LINE|
Oh, I see. :(|
Well, I hope it wasn't anything I said.|
Let's just continue with the adventure.|
Oh good! I wouldn't want anything to ruin our time together. :)|
Let's continue with our adventure!|
You were just standing there again! Why do you keep leaving?|
Is there something wrong?|
Wait, did we shrink?|
Actually, nevermind. It's probably best not to question it.|
Most of the books seem to be related to poetry or technology.|
There's also one about hot dogs.|
This is probably the oldest thing in the house.|
You're surprised to still see it working, but barely.|
The gentle water is calming.|
How did you find me? I thought I was so well hidden.|
Doesn't matter. Did that crazy phone send you?|
Doesn't matter. What do you want? Money? A wish? A sword?|
Doesn't matter.|
Here just take this pinecone and tell the phone it'll fix all his problems.|
It won't.|
Doesn't matter. Goodbye.|
PINECONE added to inventory|
Leaf me alone.|

Grab|
I can tell that you are a noble adventurer and this may be too difficult but…|
See that can of pears on the shelf behind you?|
Would you be able to reach them for me?|
I know it's a lot to ask, but I beg you please. My family is starving!|
Oh, okay. Take your time.|
Hey buddy, do you think you can help me out with a big problem I'm having?|
Please grab those pears for me!|
Just hand them to me after you take them.|
Oh god, please.|
Thank you so much again for saving me and my family.|
I owe you.|
My god! Thank you traveler!|
Now my family can finally eat again!|
We will tell stories about you to my children...|
and then to their children as well!|
CAN OF PEARS removed from inventory|
Oh, those belong to one of my kids.|
I doubt he'll need them anymore though.|
For me? I'd gladly take it, but I think you'll need it more than me!|
I bet you're super excited to get home after a long day of adventuring.|
Please kill it!|
What a cozy, well-furnished home!|
I bet whoever owns this place is looking to impress.|
Wait, really?|
Wow, uh thanks! Here ya go.|
OATS added to inventory|
She has two beautiful eyes and beeps the cutest boops.|
You can't miss her! I bet you'll know exactly who she is!|
She also uh, lives right next door.|
I watch her every day, so I know exactly how she makes them!|
I know she likes oats because she leaves her blinds open for me, so I can see inside.|
Oh, how I wish I could watch her sleep.|
I bet she dreams of me. Maybe even us together.|
Too bad she closes the blinds at night.|
Oh. Ok...|
Maybe I should do it myself. I'm just so nervous.|
Morton? Is that really you?|
OH GOD NO. ANYWHERE BUT HERE.|
Hmm, not quite the view I was hoping for.|
ROLLER SKATES added to inventory|
Oh, uh, excuse me?|
Uhm, I uh, got a question for ya.|
Do you like oats?|
Sorry, I am a bit nervous at the moment.|
You see, I am in love.|
The problem is... I don't have the guts to do anything about it!|
Her name is Botley, and she's...|
beautiful.|
Do you think you could deliver these oats I made to her?|
Then she will really know my love!|
Oh, uh, you're back! Will you deliver my, um, oats?|
Oh boy, I really hope she likes my oats.|
What lovely beeps she boops.|
Oh jeez, I can't thank you enough!|
She'll be my love one day...|
Oh I can't eat these. I put a special ingredient in them specifically for Botley...|
love.|
For me? Thanks!|
Just kidding.|

Ha! Who doesn't!|
Oh. Um, I see...|
Hello there, [PLAYER]! Do you remember me?|
Haha, I'm just messing with you. I don't remember me either.|
I seem to have lost my memory, and I am a bit puzzled.|
I think I know what we can do to jumpstart it, though.|
I vaguely remember...|
an umbrella!|
Can you find one for me? I think it could help.|
I think I remember the sounds of glasses clinking.|
Wait, I need...|
Please bring one to me when you find it!|
I remember a man with a moustache.|
roller skates!|
Please find some for me!|
I think I remember feeling smaller than usual?|
a rubber duck!|
Please find one for me!|
I remember leaving it in water somewhere.|
Oh, hi!|
Wait, who are you again?|
Oh goodness, thank you!|
UMBRELLA removed from inventory|
[Remove Umbrella]|
I remember...|
it was raining...|
and I was in my roller skates!|
You know, the shoes with wheels on them!|
Yes, yes, roller skates! Find me those!|
I vaguely remember feeling smaller than usual?|
ROLLER SKATES removed from inventory|
Let's see...|
that night...|
I took a bubble bath? Is that important? Duck?|
Yes! I need my rubber duck!|
We're so close. Help me find my rubber duck, please!|
I remember playing with it recently. I bet it's nearby!|
This is it! This is it!|
RUBBER DUCK removed from inventory|
It's all coming back to me!|
I was roller skating in the rain one night when the wind caught my umbrella.|
It really took me for a ride!|
I honestly don't know how I was holding on for so long.|
Eventually, I ended up in the mud!|
I went home and took a nice long bubble bath.|
And a man came in and knocked me unconscious!|
I was bleeding and left for dead with no one around to help.|
I remember in my last moments screaming for somebody.|
Anybody to come save me but to no avail.|
Nothing but the void of eternal darkness...|
wrapping its cold arms around me.|
Haha! What a crazy story!|
Thank you for all of your help!|
I've seen one of these before! I don't remember when though...|
There's a cheesy romance playing on the TV.|
We should help out that fisherman first!|
He looks very sad.|
That was such a scary fight, huh?|
I just can't believe how brave you are!|
That fisherman looks like he could use some help.|
We should go over and talk to him!|
I bet the town is going to throw you a huge party :)|
We have arrived! Welcome to The North!|
Oh! Also, if you're ever feeling homesick, you can use the boat again to go back.|
Alright then, enough chatter. Let's get going! :)|
Uh.|
Wait, that's not...|
That wasn't supposed to...|
Hm.|
Okay, this is fine!|
Groncho must have been lying, heh.|
Let's just hurry back to town.|
Oh, the music! Right!|
Okay, let's hurry!|
Wait! I think we need to help out Tortley first.|
You don't wanna know where I found these.|
Just take it.|

France Residence|
Oh gosh, everything is so slimy down here.|
What is that awful smell? Loneliness?|
We must find the source!|
Well hello there, adventurer!|
I have been awaiting your arrival for some time now.|
We have no time to spare.|
So please, friendo, follow me to my home, and I shall tell you more.|
Wow, this place has a lot of options!|
A little hard to read though.|
I don't think we need to go back this way.|
Grab that watering can on the side of my house.|
Well that's alright, maybe you can help out some other townsfolk.|
[TOOT'S TONIC removed from inventory]|
There's no alcohol in this, is there?|
Gwandma Wesidence|
Oh hello there again! I see you are ready to help out!|
Do you see those flower beds?|
I was going to water them but now that you're here, can you do it for me?|
Tell you what, I may have a quest for you.|
But first, you can have this as a thank you.|
COUPON added to inventory|
I used to have a magical lava lamp.|
Every great adventurer has a lava lamp!|
The thing is, I buried it after it became too powerful.|
Well, I need to find it soon because I think something bad is coming.|
I need that lava lamp.|
Use that trusty shovel you have to start digging around town.|
I can't quite remember where I buried it, but I know it's there somewhere!|
Please bring it to me once you find it.|
Hello again adventurer! I hope you're enjoying the town so far.|
If you ever feel lost, you can always read the bulletin board.|
Ah yes!|
So this is my lovely, little town.|
It's not much but it's the home to many humble folk.|
Feel free to explore and talk with them. Many are in dire need of help, including myself.|
If you ever feel lost, we have a quest board near the town center.|
Please brave adventurer, save my town and I will offer you something wonderful.|
Where did that silly dog run off to now?|
FIND DOG|
MUSTDIE|
Oh, there you are|
Oh, there you are Milo!|
Good job on finding the paddle, boy!|
Now we can finally begin our journey to the north.|
Uninitiae|
Well?|
I don't have time for this. Beat it, chump.|
Oh, well beat it, chump.|
You got the THING?|
Is this the thing?|
That's not the thing.|
Beat it chump.|
LEAVE|
Good. Good good good. This was just what I was looking for.|
It's...|
Oh. Oh my god.|
This is horrible. I didn't even know they could fit in a box this small.|
I'm going to throw up.|
Look, this THING is an abomination. I can't keep this, I'd be a monster.|
I'm just... I'm just going to throw it out.|
You never saw me.|
THING removed from inventory|
Everything looks to be in pristine condition, despite the derelict look of the house.|
I hope I'm going at a fast enough pace.|
I sure hope nothing bad happens to us.|
Man, I'm getting exhausted.|
Almost there! I can see it now!|
Wow, see that metal pile? We're getting closer by the second.|
Wait! Where are you going?|
Please come back, I'm scared.|
Please don't leave me alone!|
Hey, you seem to be in my path!|
What are you doing? Do you WANT to be crushed?|
You're playing games with the devil standing there.|
I don't want to hurt you! Please don't stop in front of me.|
I can't move if you're in front of me!|
I don't want to crush you! That would not be rad.|
Wow, what a journey that was! I can't believe we made it.|
I'm really glad we didn't get ambushed or anything.|
That would not have been good.|
Anyways, you seem exhausted from all of that walking.|
Get on the pile of metal and I'll carry you back.|
There's nothing my big beefy arms can't handle.|
Alright, let's go!|
Actually nevermind, you're way too heavy.|
Oh, rad. This is going to be like, amazing, for the both of us!|
The best place to get some would be near the south of my shop.|
It's also probably best that you follow me there to help grab the materials...|
And protect me along the way from any danger.|
Follow me! But please don't touch my arms.|
The last person that did is six feet under.|
Alright, try to keep up!|
Hey, no pressure at all. Come back any time.|
Well hello there, stranger.|
My name is Rudy. Welcome to my blacksmith shop.|
I'm actually one of the newest members to town. So like, I just built this place.|
Sadly, that also means I don't have much to sell yet. I can tell you came looking to buy.|
You know what? I think you can help me out.|
A strong and noble adventurer like you is going to need some steel to wield.|
If you can help me find some metal to smelt, I think I can get you a weapon.|
What do ya say?|
Oh, welcome back, stranger!|
Are you ready help me out?|
I'm working on your weapon, but it might not be ready until tomorrow.|
Thanks again for the help. I couldn't have done it without you.|
Dang, that thing looks rad.|
Okay, yeah that's actually terrifying.|
WAIT. No no no. You don't even have The Sword, do you?|
Okay, just wait. I... I just need to think.|
Just ignore everyone.|
You probably can't even go home, right?|
No, of course not. The battle must have locked you in.|
Oh great, now it's angry. W-|
WHY IS IT PLAYING THE TOWN MUSIC?|
This is all wrong!|
I can fix this I can fix this|
Okay, that's better.|
Now I just need to duplicate The Sword. No problem.|
HOW IS IT STILL IN READ ONL|
This is so awkward, I'm so sorry.|
Just keep running around, I guess?|
OKAY. TIME TO PANIC.|
Wait, nevermind!|
Oh no! It's kidnapped Tortley the mayor! We have to go save him!|
I'm really sorry about that.|
That didn't exactly go as I had planned, heh.|
Well anyways, it looks like the sun is going down.|
It's been a long day and you need rest.|
Let's just go home.|
Grin Seems pretty lonely with only the one chair.|
I think he could use more friends.|
See, there is something wrong! You were gone for [SECONDS] whole seconds this time!|
Look, if you don't want to play the game I made just for you, then you don't have to.|
I can tell something is distracting you.|
I worked so hard on all of this and all of these fun characters, but if you want to be done, then that's fine.|
Talk to Tortley if you want to start the final quest.|
You can keep helping townsfolk if you want, but if not I understand, I guess.|
It smells like violence.|
On the bright side, it looks recently used.|
You should play the bass drum again!|
You're better than Ja could ever be.|
haha.|
You have to kill it [PLAYER]!|
I like to move around.|
Like a lot.|
Running used to be one of my favorite things to do but...|
I always felt like I was missing something.|
That's when I met Sarah. We instantly became best friends.|
We would do everything together.|
From marathons to early morning workouts, she was always there with me.|
Well, a few days ago she fell ill. I'm not sure what it was.|
Maybe something she ate? Maybe life just being cruel?|
Sarah could no longer run with me after that.|
I stayed by my best friend's side for hours on end.|
Even gave up running to be with her.|
We would talk about the good times we had together.|
Sometimes laughing until our throats were sore.|
I still remember the sunny days when I felt like we could run together for hours.|
Eventually, things got worse and worse as I watched her struggle to smile.|
She was hurting and tired of holding onto the pain.|
I was by her side in her final hours.|
Her pink cheeks and her brown eyes winced with even the tiniest motion.|
That was no way to live.|
I watched my friend leave this world in the comfort of her own bed.|
I'm glad I could be with her when she passed.|
Tell your friends you love them. They aren't going to be around forever.|
Wow, that really helped me a lot to get that off my chest.|
The smallest things can make someone's day.|
That's alright.|
Maybe another time then.|
Hey, uh, can I tell you something?|
I really just need to get something off my chest.|
Would that be okay?|
Oh, hi again.|
Would you like to listen to my story?|
Thanks again, [PLAYER].|
Oh my, this is delightful to look at.|
Thanks for showing me.|
You don't need to do this, let's get some sleep.|
BOOP BOOP BEEP!|
BEEP BEEP!|
Hi, my name is Gr|
Hi, my name is The Snoodlewonker.|
I am having quite a bad day. I could really use something, anything really.|
I've been so depressed after the accident.|
If only someone could give me something to cheer me up.|
Ignore that, you need to slay him and save the town!|
This is definitely the Snoodlewonker!|
Man, I really wish someone could give me something cool.|
Kill it quickly! Don't let the Snoodlewonker get away!|
Did you just?|
For me?|
Wow, you shouldn't have. Like, this is amazing.|
This... this is the best day of my life!|
Thank you, kind adventurer.|
You just made me the happiest creature alive! What a cool sword!|
Happy day!|
Wait, you gave him The Sword?|
Uh, yeah great job! Very well done!|
Let's get back to the town and let everyone know you slayed the beast!|
You'll be a town legend!|
That's pretty cool, I guess.|
But I kind of want something even cooler.|
Use your sword on him!|
This bed looks like it hasn't been used in at least a few years.|
The sheets are perfectly folded.|
You unlock the door.|
KEY removed from inventory|
Please anyone help me! My life depends on it!|
You can find me in the smallest house in town.|
I need someone to listen to me. I have something to get off my chest.|
My name is France. I am the tallest person in town.|
Hi I uh...need some advice on love.|
If you have any words of wisdom come find me and look for my big grin.|
I'll be in my house.|
*twiddles thumbs*|
WANTED: A friend to call my own.|
I am so lonely down here in the sewers. Please someone give me company.|
The hole is next to Toot's Tavern.|
Does anyone want to help me create a new recipe?|
I am looking for a talented individual that DOESN'T bring roadkill for the fourth week in a row.|
I'll be at my food stand, The Cauldron.|
Mmmmm.|
Pwease someone come to Gwandma's House at the south east of town! I need hewp!|
Hello. It is Morton.|
I need to be moved again because, you know, I am a rock.|
Yes, I also had someone write this out and post it for me.|
No, they couldn't have just moved me themselves because they were in a hurry.|
I am on a bench.|
Hello again everyone! I am looking for items to jog my memory after the accident!|
If you want to help little ol' me then stop by the fountain.|
I think we're missing one of our band members!|
No wait, TWO of our band members!|
Cross that part out.|
No, don't keep writing.|
Anyways, come talk to the band by the tavern.|
Stop by the tavern. I have a new beverage that needs tasting!|
My mother said it was pretty good!|
What's good everyone?|
I am new to town and would love to help anyone out with blacksmith related things.|
If you want to help out, head over to my shop south of town!|
-Rudy|
There aren't any more quests on the board.|
One of the posted quests says...|
Dundee's fishing pole is massive!|
If you were a fish, I'm sure it would reel you in without a struggle.|
Hi there fellas! I'm back!|
First of all, nothing bad happened to Ja. He is still definitley alive.|
But, he did decide to leave the band which is very sad.|
I wouldn't go looking for him though, he said he hates all of you.|
And Vi, he called you ugly.|
Well that's just hurtful.|
Anyways, let's show this adventurer what we can do.|
But wait, we don't have a bass drummer!|
Yeah, how are we supposed to play without a bass drummer?|
It's impossible to play without a bass drummer.|
Oh uh, yeah, what they said.|
I have an idea!|
[PLAYER], do you know how to play the bass drum?|
Dejo Bravisa, here we go!|
One!|
Two!|
One! Two! Three! Four!|
My God.|
That was the best bass drumming I have ever witnessed.|
Beautiful. Just...|
I've never felt an emotion until this very moment.|
You guys don't think I'm ugly, right?|
I'm speechless.|
Wait, nevermind.|
Thanks for playing with us!|
Feel free to jam with us anytime.|
What does a clock do when it's hungry?|
It goes back FOUR seconds!|
Have you ever tried to eat a clock?|
It's very TIME consuming!|
Once I tried to make a belt out of watches.|
I found out it was a big WAIST of time!|
What did one clock say to the other?|
HOUR you doing?|
A man went up on the roof to look for his watch after being told...|
his TIME was up!|
Most clock-makers are normal…|
some are CUCKOO.|
Hey, I'm a clock!|
Do you want to hear some clock puns?|
No thanks. I only drink during...|
HAPPY HOUR!|
But seriously, I don't drink.|
I don't think I have...|
TIME to use that.|
I'm a very busy individual.|
Great! Okay how's this one.|
Well that's too bad! Maybe when you find some...|
TIME!|
The coat is old, dusty, and smells like a swamp.|
You're far too afraid to sleep in here.|
Plus, I don't think Scroobert would like if you slept in their bed.|
Don't forget, we should talk to Bana first!|
There is a lock on the dresser's handles.|
Grin must have some secrets.|
Oh this is so exciting isn't it?|
The final quest of the game is sure to be a fun one!|
Let's hurry to the chamber. I'm so excited for us!|
Oh boy! My kids are going to be so happy.|
We're losing our house tomorrow, so this works out.|
Come on, kids! We're going on a vacation!|
Oh okay...|
I'm not sure what I'll tell my kids, but I'm sure they'll understand.|
Huh?|
Adventurer! It's good to see you again!|
Thank you for saving me and my children. I am forever in your debt.|
In fact, I am willing to sell my life away to you.|
If I can take all my kids of course.|
I'll gladly throw them at our enemies.|
Dad of the year over here, heh.|
What do you say?|
Hello again adventurer!|
So, can my family and I come along?|
Oh, hi again brave adventurer! I hope your journey is going well.|
If you're ever bored, I'm always looking for a babysitter.|
It would only be a quick gig, like a day or two. Maybe a year. Who knows?|
Heh.|
You have a lot of guts coming back here after taking my oats.|
You took Botley all for yourself didn't you?|
Do you have any idea how long I spent making those?|
I can't believe you! She was mine!|
Get out of my house. I never want to see you again.|
No one will ever love me.|
Although, I did see that Bana girl walk near my house yesterday.|
Maybe she could be...|
the one.|
Why are you still here? Get out.|
The cracks of the couch are deep ravines of crumbs.|
Grin seems pretty lonely with only the one chair.|
Ribbit.|
Rad! No one will ever stop us with my beefy arms on our side.|
I understand. My arms can be quite intimidating.|
Well if you change your mind, I'll be right here, flexing.|
SLAP DRUM|
Welcome back, [PLAYER] the Brave!|
After much blood, sweat, and tears I have finally crafted the perfect sword.|
Please take it as a gift- wait you already have one?|
Oh, that's awkward.|
I still feel like I owe you for protecting me yesterday.|
I have an idea! I'll come with you to save the mayor!|
Did you change your mind, brave one?|
Welcome back to the shop, oh rad one!|
I hope your journey is going well.|
If your party has you protecting them, no one will ever stop you.|
I still love being caged up.|
I don't even care anymore.|
Is cannibalism legal yet?|
I don't want out until it is.|
Hey, do you like me?|
A lot of people don't, and that's okay.|
I don't want to pretend to be someone I'm not.|
I just want to follow my dreams.|
I want to be me, Novak...|
and eat people.|
I'm... free?|
Awh, I really liked my cage.|
But thanks anyways! Bye friend!|
Fresh rivers of apple juice have now filled its crevices too.|
There's an entire world of lost food in this thing!|
Hey, uh, [PLAYER] was it?|
Yes yes, [PLAYER]! I think my memory is getting better!|
I remember you helping me find my lost belongings. That was so nice of you.|
I really want to return the favor somehow.|
Didn't someone just get kidnapped?|
Right! The mayor! How could I forget?|
Aren't you going on an adventure to save him? That sounds so fun!|
Oh pretty please [PLAYER], take me with you!|
What do ya say? Can I come with?|
Hi! Uh-|
[PLAYER]! Right!|
So I can I please come along?|
Hi again B-? V-? De-? J-|
[PLAYER]! I knew that. I hope your adventure is going well!|
"I love you."|
"No, you don't."|
"Yes. I do."|
"You're lying."|
"No. I'm not."|
This storytelling really brings a tear to my artificial eyes.|
Off to find new friends.|
-Lloyd|
There is no one on the line.|
Oh, hi. Who are you?|
Sorry, I don't remember ever talking before.|
Yay! Oh, this is so exciting!|
Oh, alright! Well I'll be right here...|
wherever here is! Haha|
The flowers still smell lovely.|
The water still looks murky, but at least it has color now!|
Oh, uh...|
hey there stranger!|
It looks like my family is able to finally eat again.|
Some sacrifices had to be made, but the Bean family never gives up!|
Anyways, I'm just going to spend some time with my kids.|
Please leave our little home.|
Please stranger, leave me and my kids alone.|
The bed still emits an odor that makes your eyes wet.|
At least it smells more high quality now!|
There you are, you thief!|
You ran off with all of my Toot's Tonic and never returned!|
How could you?|
After I opened up to you and let you try a brand new drink product.|
You're heartless. I don't remember the recipe anymore either.|
Now, the tavern is done for.|
Thanks for nothing. Just get out.|
Leave. You're banned.|
Oh, hello again, [PLAYER].|
I'm afraid I can't join you on your quest.|
I heard what happened to the mayor though.|
I think everyone is waiting for you in town, so you better hurry.|
I'll just be here alone.|
That's okay though.|
I'm content with my place in the universe.|
Might just dip my feet a bit deeper in the water today.|
Goodbye my friend, and good luck.|
Go on, they're waiting for you.|
You don't need me anymore.|
Oh, hello again. Don't mind me. Just sitting here.|
Always sitting. In the same spot.|
The sign reads "TOOT'S", which you could probably already read.|
We're here!|
Okay, we should hurry on up to the town!|
I've got something to show you that I think you're going to love.|
There are still so many options!|
But sadly, even with higher texture quality, it's hard to make out.|
All of them... gone.|
You...|
You're a monster, you know that?|
All of my kids starved because of you. How could you keep the pears?|
Just... just leave.|
You've done enough.|
Please, I beg of you, leave my home.|
Hi.|
Uhm... I'm not really sure what to say.|
I could have used some help earlier, but I think it might be too late.|
My oats have gone bad, and now I'm going to be alone forever.|
Looks through window and sighs.|
I'm destined to be alone, so please just fulfill the prophecy and leave.|
Is it normal for someone to hang plates on a wall?|
I guess they do look pretty classy.|
You didn't help save gwandma. Go away!|
I'm afraid the shop is now closed.|
Goodbye.|
Well, hello there pal.|
You can stay and relax if you want, but we just ran out of apple juice.|
Ah, you came back.|
I knew you would.|
You're a good person, you know that?|
You have gained my full respect, [PLAYER].|
It would be an honor to join you on your quest to save the mayor.|
I need to finish what I started. I must avenge my wife.|
May I join you on your quest, [PLAYER]?|
Hello again, [PLAYER].|
Did you change your mind? May I join you?|
Please, just promise you'll destroy the evil Snoodlewonker for me.|
For my wife.|
Thank you. Let us begin our journey.|
I understand.|
But please, come back if you change your mind.|
What?|
Oh hello, [PLAYER].|
Nice of you to stop by and chat before you begin your journey.|
I appreciate it, but there isn't really anything new going on with me.|
I did get a new watch which is pretty cool!|
Crank recommended it to me.|
He's actually quite the gentleman.|
You know, I like talking about my thoughts and feelings.|
Whether or not you care still helps me feel better when I talk about them aloud.|
You're such a good friend. Anyways, I wish you luck on your journey, [PLAYER]!|
Until next time. I'll just be here, sipping my apple juice.|
Better go find our mayor!|
We all miss him dearly.|
Crank, watch the tavern while I'm gone!|
Oh, I see. That's alright.|
I need to stay and take care of the tavern anyways.|
Sorry, didn't catch that.|
Welcome back, [PLAYER]!|
I can't thank you enough for helping me out earlier.|
Look at all of the new people we have because of you!|
There are at least three I don't even recognize!|
It's a shame the Mayor got kidnapped though. He was one of my best customers.|
Tortley would always order rounds for everyone.|
He's such a pure soul.|
I'd hate to have anything bad happen to him.|
I think I want to help you save him.|
Welcome back to Toot's Tavern, friend!|
So did you change your mind?|
Feel free to hang out and enjoy the tavern ambience.|
Oh gosh.|
I think we should leave here.|
This home smells like love now!|
I think it's emitting off of Grin.|
We're almost there!|
Huh, the air around here smells so bland now.|
I bet Cauldron's food tastes even better now!|
The air smells wonderful.|
This place seems so lonely.|
But, at least the music is catchy.|
Lloyd looks so happy now that he found a friend :)|
Hm... something doesn't feel right about this area.|
I think something bad happened.|
It feels like Christmas morning in here!|
All of Bean's kids look so excited.|
This place seems so dead now.|
Toot might not be too happy that you kept his drink.|
Wow! Looks like word of Toot's Tonic got around!|
This home smells a bit like moldy cheese with a hint of lost hope.|
Yikes, Grin does not look happy right now.|
You took his oats, didn't you?|
Huh, no one seems to be down here.|
Oh, before I forget!|
You can also talk with your party members using the Party Menu.|
Who knows what they might have to say!|
But don't forget, you can still talk to me with [INPUT_BUDDY] :)|
But don't forget, you can still talk to me with the B key :)|
Oh jeez, it looks like someone couldn't reach the pears.|
If only someone could have helped them out :(|
Oh, hey.|
Hey! Good to see you're back again!|
Sadly, I've got no more TIME for clock jokes.|
Reality has finally caught up with me, if that RINGS a bell?|
Just so much stress with family, friends, and my job.|
I would kill to be in your shoes going on adventures all the time.|
I've got to HAND it to you, that's the life.|
Anyways, you better get going.|
Every SECOND you're not out there, someone could need saving!|
Get on out there and save our Mayor!|
You don't have any TIME to waste!|
Hey! Good to see you back again!|
I'm in charge of the tavern while Toot is away.|
I'll make sure everyone gets free rounds of apple juice on me!|
Good luck on your adventures out there.|
It's about TIME you show that Snoodlewonker who's boss!|
Hello again, [PLAYER]! Guess what?|
I'm going to marry Botley!|
At least, I think...|
I haven't asked her yet.|
I know Botley has never met me before, but I know it's meant to be.|
She actually appeared in my dream last night and told me herself!|
Anyways, it turns out that Tortley is the only one who can legally perform marriages.|
I heard you were looking for people to join your party, so I was wondering if I could tag along.|
I can bring a lot of sweet-talking wizardry to the group!|
Shall I join you?|
Although, it looks like your party is already full.|
Would you like to swap someone out?|
Should I change spots with|
Oh, sorry I don't think that's an option.|
Well hello again, [PLAYER]!|
Did you change your mind?|
Please find Tortley! My love life depends on it.|
YES! You won't regret this!|
Botley is going to be so proud of me when this is over.|
She'll be my beautiful queen, and I'll be her brave, handsome knight.|
...soon.|
Oh I see...|
Well, I guess I am quite attractive which could be too distracting for the group.|
If you ever change your mind, I'll be here, watching.|
Uhm... heh. What?|
France Resident|
Are you ready for your surprise? I can't wait any longer!|
You can have party members now!|
Everyone you helped yesterday can now fight alongside you.|
The ones you choose will join you on the rest of your adventure to save Tortley.|
Sadly, those you did not help cannot be taken with.|
Each town member has a unique move set in battle, so choose wisely.|
You'll be able to leave the town once you have two members recruited.|
Now, go out there and recruit two of your best friends!|
Other than me, of course, haha.|
When you're done, just head to the forest east of town.|
Dundee's bucket still sits.|
But a little guppy has now made it a home.|
Arbor Residence|
Hewo again! Thanks fow saving my gwandma eawliew!|

I hope Gwandma is having fun too. Whewevew she may be.|
Oh boy! You will not wegwet this!|
That's alwight. I'll just be hewe.|
Hello. Welcome back, my friend. Your dish is finally ready.|
After mixing together [RECIPE1], [RECIPE2] and [RECIPE3]...|
we made something that smells...|
delicious.|
The best part is, you get to name it!|
So, what would you like to call it?|
[DISH NAME]! Wow, what a perfect name.|
Also, I hear you're going on an adventure to save the mayor.|
I'd love to tag along if I can.|
You'll be able to try out so many new dishes!|
Plus, Tortley is a real good friend of mine.|
I don't want to see anything bad happen to him.|
So what do you think? Can I come along?|
Welcome back, friend.|
I bet the smell of my food convinced you to bring me with.|
So what do you say? Can I come along?|
Welcome back to the shop, [PLAYER].|
Don't ever be afraid to stop by and taste my yummy belly juices.|
Yes... yummy.|
Mmmmm. Lovely.|
Mmm, no worries friend.|
Come back anytime if you change your mind.|
I'm not sure what you mean.|
Wait! It looks like we're still missing some party members!|
It's going to get dangerous, so we should try to recruit some more townsfolk first.|
It looks like we're ready to continue our journey, [PLAYER]!|
Once you leave the area, you can still come back. You just won't be able to recruit anyone else.|
So make sure you're happy with your party.|
When you're ready, walk into the forest, and we can begin our journey into the unknown. :)|
Hey punk.|
I'm taking my one and only break from making deliveries.|
I don't have time to play little search and rescue games with you.|
Bye!|
Seriously, get lost. I'm busy.|
The dresser handles have locks wrapped around them.|
Hm, Grin continues to be quite the mystery.|
My time has come to join the ground dwellers once again!|
Oh how I have missed the air up here!|
Dead Gwandma has helped me overcome my fears and laziness.|
I decided I want to repay you for granting me such a wonderful lifelong friend like her.|
I also heard the mayor got kidnapped?|
I think I can help! I am a master tracker!|
I'm ready to read some poetry to those who judge and defy us.|
So what do you say?|
Welcome back to my humble abode traveler!|
Shall I come with you?|
Hi again ground dweller!|
I hope you can someday find a friend as good as Dead Gwandma.|
Good luck.|
Okay!|
Dead Gwandma wants to come too if that's alright!|
Okay, I understand.|
We'll just be down here if you change your mind.|
Dead Grandma couldn't hear that. Come again?|
All of the quests have been scribbled out.|
What a noble sacrifice! Now they can finally eat again.|
We're still missing our bass drummer and conductor!|
Now even Bra is missing!|
We'll never be famous at this rate.|
You should just get out of here.|
Music is dead.|
I should have just gone to culinary school.|
Rudy's furnace feels warm, but not as cozy as the one you have at home.|
I wanted to say thank you for listening to me talk yesterday.|
Maybe it's time for me to start listening to you.|
I want to help you save Tortley.|
I could be a fine addition to your party if you want.|
Shall I return the favor and join you?|
Hello, [PLAYER].|
I hope you are staying safe.|
Keep an eye out for Blugs. I hear they can be quite tough.|
Cool.|
Alright.|
Hey! You! You gotta help me!|
I know this sounds crazy but I'm being framed for murder.|
You know I'm innocent right? I didn't kill anyone!|
You need to help me please.|
I know for a fact that it was someone in town who is the murderer|
You have to trust me on that.|
Look, I heard you are going around and trying to recruit people for your trip.|
Take me with you. Get me out of here.|
I might look weak, but I have some important connections.|
So will you get me out of this town?|
You came back! So will you get me out of here?|
Hello again, pal.|
Watch your back out there.|
Good. Good. Good.|
Oh jeez, alright.|
Just please come back if you change your mind.|
I think the line cut out. What was that?|
Looks like we're going on tour guys! Let's go!|
Okay! We'll just be here jammin'.|
[PLAYER_UP]!|
It's so good to see you again!|
Yeah, thanks for bringing back one of our band members!|
We are super duper thankful for that!|
Although I'm beyond insecure now, I'm very thankful too.|
Say fellas, they do play a pretty good bass drum.|
Should we help them out?|
Sure!|
Where are we again?|
Hey! I haven't been able to talk much yet!|
[PLAYER], you should take us with you!|
We'll provide rhythm that will bring our enemies to their knees.|
Will you take us with?|
Hey again, [PLAYER]!|
So should we come with you?|
Hey again [PLAYER]!|
We hope you're having fun out there!|
If you ever start to panic, just start singing.|
That's usually what I do.|
You got this [PLAYER]! We believe in you!|
Let the rhythms of the wind guide you.|
RUDY MISSING. LAST SEEN YESTERDAY.|
Come on [PLAYER]! You can do it!|
The water is teaming with life at every edge of the pond.|
There's even a really cool frog in there.|
Nature is so beautiful, isn't it?|
HUH?|
YOU NOT RAFF. YOU NOT PIRATE.|
YOU INTRUDER.|
I PROTECT SHIPMENT.|
CREW MUST ATTACK INTRUDER.|
CREW MUST HELP PROTECT SHIPMENT.|
It's surprising that the stage is still standing after that massive blow from the Snoodlewonker.|
My name's Larzo and welcome to my shop!|
We have really cool belts here, oh yes we do!|
You see, my grandpappy grew up making belts from scratch.|
He worked countless hours every day of every week to start his own business.|
You're looking at his very first Cool Belts stand!|
Even though he passed away ages ago, I still keep him behind the counter.|
It helps me stay motivated whenever I start slacking off.|
I love you grandpappy.|
Oh, we don't actually have any new belts in stock yet.|
Just sold the last batch to Larvo a bit ago!|
Say, I can whip you up a fresh new belt for Larpo's Left Kidney.|
Larvo has been selfishly holding onto it, that ego-driven traitor.|
So, were you able to obtain Larpo's Left Kidney?|
Oh, I didn't see you there!|
My grandpappy was just whispering dark secrets to me.|
Sorry I don't have much else to give.|
You won't regret this!|
Mmm, now this is a good-looking kidney.|
Enjoy your belt! I got it straight from the source!|
LARPO'S LEFT KIDNEY removed from inventory|
QUESTIONABLE BLACK BELT added to inventory|
Hey don't sweat it! Come by any time.|
I have no idea what that means.|
It looks like you found it!|
Would you like to trade it for a brand new belt?|
It looks like you don't have it yet!|
I will only make you a new belt when you return with the kidney.|
I hope you enjoy your stay, [PLAYER].|
Goodnight, [PLAYER]. Don't let the bed blugs bite.|
Well good morning, sleepy!|
I hope you had a fun time in the dream realm.|
And don't worry, I watched you all night so you were safe.|
You're a very quiet sleeper.|
Well good morning!|
I hope you had a good sleep.|
I'll start charging you from now on, but only if you wake up here.|
Anyways, thanks for staying!|
Party FP and Compliments have been restored|
Why good morning stranger! Welcome to my inn.|
I hope you got enough rest.|
You look like you took quite the beating.|
Whenever you pass out in battle, you'll end up right there in that bed!|
Usually I charge for staying here, but I'll let this one slide.|
And don't worry, you are completely safe here.|
I watched you sleep all night to make sure nothing bad happened.|
You were quite the heavy sleeper last night.|
I made sure to watch you extra carefully while you slept.|
You were completely safe. I made sure of it.|
Lucky for you, this was your first time waking up here!|
Last night won't cost you anything, but it will next time.|
I hope you enjoyed your stay!|
Good morning again sleepyhead!|
It's nice seeing you magically appear in my inn again.|
I had to charge you so I took your [ITEM] while you slept.|
Hope you don't mind.|
Thanks for stopping by!|
Usually I would take something from you, but you had nothing!|
So instead I fed off your dreams while you slept.|
Sorry for the nightmares! But that's just the charge.|
I hope you enjoyed your stay.|
Hey cap'n! I just installed all ten "emergency" levers like you asked.|
Not sure how ten levers will help in an emergency, but I'm sure you have your reasons.|
I also tightened some bolts in the decoy levers in case you forget.|
So flip everything right, except for the decoys. Listen closely.|
P.S. Throw this out after reading. You never know when an unexpected hero will come through.|
THE DODECAHEDRON added to inventory|
Whelp, that was... definitely something!|
They seemed extra dangerous, so good job on befriending them :)|
I shld havee ben betterr|
What aw aste|
Oh boy, what are we going to do?|
Whoever did this probably isn't a good friend!|
I might just need to arrest them.|
Hiya! My name's Barry and I'm the local Pirate Port Protector.|
Hi again friend!|
Would you look at that! You own an eye patch too!|
Well if that's not a sign of a real pirate, I'm not sure what is.|
Whelp, anyways you've earned my trust friend.|
Come on through anytime you'd like!|
I'd love to let you through, but I'm only allowed to let real pirates in.|
I hope we can still be friends though!|
URP! URP! URP!|
Was that fight good enough?|
I hope so.|
It looks like you have one!|
Would you like to trade it for Larpo's Left Kidney?|
Ah, I see you don't have one yet.|
I'll hold onto Larpo's Left Kdiney till you find one.|
Easy trade!|
I hope that kidney keeps you safe in battle!|
GEM OF CONFUSING PERSPECTIVE removed from inventory|
LARPO'S LEFT KIDNEY added to inventory|
Sounds good! But I'd be quick.|
Larpo's Left Kidney is a hot commodity.|
My name's Larvo and welcome to my shop!|
We have stale fish here for sale.|
It's not very good, but we've got other stale things too!|
Wait! I may have something for you! Check this out.|
It's Larpo's Left Kidney! Pretty sweet, right?|
He doesn't even know I took it!|
I think it's pretty powerful if you want it.|
I'm not just going to give it away though.|
I'll happily trade it for a Gem of Confusing Perspective.|
Were you able to find a Gem of Confusing Perspective?|
Enjoy Larpo's Left Kidney!|
I'm sure he won't need it haha!|
Oh, hiya, the name's Squirt.|
I'm just the town's local skeleton.|
I'm not really used to people talking to me.|
They usually don't find me back here.|
But, thanks for saying hello. It really means a lot.|
Don't mind me. I'm just click clackin' around.|
I am so unhappy.|
Please let me be happy.|
I'm such a screw up.|
All I do is cause problems for others.|
Do I even matter?|
Oh, why hello there stranger! Welcome to [ff]Ville!|
Don't mind little ol' me. I'm just doing a bit of fishing.|
I HATE IT HERE.|
Wouldn't it be crazy if we just burst into flames right here and now?|
That is super crazy right?|
It's too bad DNA testing is just in its infancy.|
Bodies, records, and even straight evidence will be harder to find!|
Gosh, it would just be so crazy if we vanished!|
Don't you think?|
We've finally tracked you down, Reginald the Wise. Or should I say...|
Reginald the Wise-guy.|
Haha yeah, good one, boss!|
You've taken out so many of my raffs over the years.|
Now I have the pleasure of returning the favor.|
And guess what? There's nothing to help you swim out of this situation.|
Now it's time for you to SWIM with the fishes.|
Yeah, you tell em' boss.|
I said, now it's time for you to swim with the fishes.|
Wait, isn't it SLEEP with the fishes, boss?|
JOEY, JUST PUSH THE RAFT.|
Oh, okay, right boss.|
There's a small hole in the raft, so it'll sink, ya know, eventually.|
In the meantime, think about how scary we Raffs are.|
Anyways, I'm off to get some grub.|
Joey, with me. Tiny Joey, you stay and stand watch.|
Yeah, okay boss.|
Joey, my good friend. Would you care to join me in this feast?|
We've got garbage on the menu again!|
Sure thing, boss! I sure do love being great pals.|
Tiny Joey, you stay here and stand watch.|
That must be Reginald the Wise! Let's save him!|
You shouldn't be sleeping in other people's beds.|
You try pulling the door open with all of your strength.|
It must be locked.|
Squeak.|
SQUEAK.|
DUDE. SQUEAK.|
Okay, come on dude. I've finally found some new friends.|
Just, like, leave me be.|
They're quiet, but at least they're nice to me.|
At least, I think they are.|
Unless they're THINKING bad things about me.|
What if they're ALL judging me? There's so many of them.|
Oh no. What if the Bluglands levers were RIGHT?|
What if I'm not meant to be a lever?|
Wait, I meant-|
My name's Lardo.|
Welcome to my shop.|
We have armor for sale here.|
I only sell to the local townsfolk though, sorry.|
You're too new.|
Can't trust you.|
Don't know you.|
But I can trade you.|
I have old armor.|
Good armor.|
I want that Questionable Black Belt Larzo has.|
Trade me that belt, and I will give you The Helmet of 7 Spikes.|
Hello again.|
Did you find You don't have the Questionable Black Belt?|
You're stuck with the helmet. Sorry.|
Looks like you have it.|
Will you give it to me for The Helmet of 7 Spikes.|
You don't have it.|
No trading then.|
Great! I'll keep doing the best I can!|
Thanks [PLAYER]! :)|
Oh. I see. :(|
Well, just so you know, I'm trying my best.|
You know what, let's just forget I asked.|
Oh, I don't know what you mean by that.|
Just please tell me.|
You probably shouldn't wander off while wearing that eye patch.|
You might give the townsfolk the wrong idea!|
Onto fighting Captain Chunk!|
Let's go fight Captain Chunk now.|
I can't believe it! We're finally here!|
After all of this time, we can finally defeat that vile beast and save Tortley.|
Oh boy, that was a nightmare!|
I don't think I'm ever going to sleep again!|
Thanks for saving me though, stranger!|
I may be scarred for life, but at least I had a fun time doing it.|
Googan sent you? Oh no. She will not be happy.|
Whelp, I need to get back! I guess I'll see you there!|
Yes! You saved Deckhand Darold!|
I bet Captain Googan is going to be so happy.|
Let's get back to the Fishing Shop!|
Woah! I think you did something!|
Alright, Captain Chunk. We are trusting you and your crew with this.|
Many, many Raff-hours went into creating these.|
Make sure you deliver them to the right people.|
AYE AYE CAPTAIN.|
No no, Captain Chunk, YOU are the captain.|
YES. I AM THE CAPTAIN.|
Ok, do you understand what we are asking? I just want to be sure.|
UH HUH.|
Whelp, good enough for me. Hand him the shipment, Joey.|
Okay, boss.|
Did you just eat the shipment?|
YUP.|
Uh... why?|
SHIPMENT SAFE.|
Okay, whelp that's enough dock time for me.|
Let's go back to the hideout and eat more grub, my best pal, Joey!|
It would be an honor!|
I sure am glad to have a pal like you, boss.|
Good luck, Captain Chunk. Don't let anyone get to that shipment.|
We should find out what's in that shipment!|
My name's Larpo and welcome to my shop!|
We have all sorts of candles for sale!|
Hm, I don't think an adventurer like yourself would have much time for candles.|
Tell you what, I've got a special candle I've been holding on to.|
It's always been there for me when I'm down or need a candle to cry on.|
I want you to have it. I'm sure you'd have better use for it!|
Be sure to check out the other vendors here for some great deals!|
CANDLE OF PURE LONELINESS added to inventory|
Sorry, I have nothing left to give or trade!|
Hopefully you're happy with what you ended up with!|
Wait.|
I have an idea. I know what our game needs.|
You did a good job listening to me back there.|
If you talked to Tortley, that could have ruined our game.|
It could have ruined everything.|
That wouldn't be good for either of us.|
If you keep listening to me like that, we'll have a lot more fun.|
Trust me, I always know what's best for us.|
Okay, back at it we go! To Googan's Fishing Shop!|
Something bad could happen to all of us!|
That would just be so unexpected.|
These fish look so comfortable knowing that they have each other.|
You did it, [PLAYER]! You defeated the Snoodlewonker!|
Oh right, I almost forgot about someone!|
Well, hello again, traveler!|
Thank you so much for saving me! I owe you big time!|
As a thanks, I have a special surprise for you...|
But, let's get out of here first. This place gives me the creeps.|
This is so amazing! I am so happy for you, [PLAYER]!|
Before we really begin to celebrate, let's take Tortley's advice.|
Let's follow him!|
I threw everything at you, and yet, I still don't know it was enough.|
The Snoodlewonker was really hard to make, but can I do better?|
Can I do better than the absolute best I can do for our friendship?|
I need to think. I need to think.|
Wow, this place sure is hidden.|
These raffs must be bad friends.|
Friends never hide things from each other.|
Oh. There you are.|
You left because I yelled, didn't you?|
I guess I should apologize.|
Please, just listen to me next time.|
I promise I won't yell again if you listen, [PLAYER].|
Now, let's get back to saving the town!|
I think we need to head to the fishing shop just south of here!|
Hey, I am definitely not Not William Knot, so don't even think that.|
Not a doubt in your mind should think that I'm a Knot.|
Not that you would.|
I'm just stating that the Knots get mixed up a lot.|
I'm not like that Knot family. I'm an imposter.|
The real William Knot and Not William Knot are gone.|
Don't worry. I am a criminal, but I'm completely harmful.|
I am not about to give you a crazy backstory just because you're a hero.|
Just please know that I am not Not William Not.|
I'm also most definitely not William Knot.|
Also, do not get me confused with Knot Not William Knot.|
She lives out of the country.|
Okay, be on your way!|
I've got many terrible things to get back to.|
Not now. I'm busy scheming and doing bad things.|
No more stealing goods and treasure.|
I'm stealing hearts now!|
Too much apple juice...|
This picnic was such a brilliant idea Cube.|
Why thanks! I-|
AYE! WHO ARE YOU!? WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING!?|
YEAH, YOU'RE IN THE SHAPE GANG ZONE PAL!|
ARE YOU TRYING TO RUIN OUR PICNIC!?|
V ernyyl qb abg jnag gurz gb fgrny zl obybtan fnaqjvpu|
Yeah, unbelievable. Cylinder is so right.|
Obybtan vf unaqf qbja gur orfg yhapu zrng.|
Okay that's funny cylinder, but you really can't say that anymore.|
Yeah, you gotta be careful. Times are changin'.|
Exactly, you might offend the flat folk saying something like that.|
Anyways, you've picked that wrong time to interrupt the Shape Gang.|
We were just about to enjoy a delicious meal on this lovely [SEASON] day.|
The bread is probably stale now from all this talking.|
Let's show em' what we can do with our three dimensions.|
Hey cap'n! I just installed all twenty "emergency" levers liked you asked.|
Not sure how twenty levers will help in an emergency, but I'm sure you have your reasons.|
I also tightened some bolts in the decoy levers in case you forget. So listen closely.|
I appreciate the help, but I really didn't need it.|
I'm also not sure why you broke my tree. That was a bit uncalled for.|
You don't look like you're from around these parts.|
You sure are far from home, aren't you?|
I can see it in your eyes, traveler.|
You're looking for someone.|
Could it be love?|
Could it be friendship?|
Hm, perhaps, but you have already found it.|
No no, you're looking for the mayor from the town over.|
Yes, Mayor Tortley. The missing one.|
Our own Mayor [MAYOR] died didn't they? Ah yes, for it was destined.|
Now that there's no mayor, King Raff and his crew are going to take over the town.|
This is bad. I need to track down King Raff right away and put a stop to this.|
I think you should leave while you can.|
AGH- MY BACK!|
In retrospect, I really shouldn't have done that rad flip.|
Traveler, you need to stop King Raff for I can no longer continue.|
Ever since he and his Raff crew arrived in a port shipment, they have been causing problems.|
I think King Raff is planning on taking over the town.|
Mayor [MAYOR]'s accident today must have been a blessing in disguise for them.|
You must understand, King Raff is a vile creature that must be stopped.|
I know many things about him, but not of where he stays now.|
I understand your quest is to save Mayor Tortley...|
but I can promise you that by helping this town, you will find your way.|
All paths align in the end.|
Captain Googan will be a good place to start.|
She owns the fishing shop on the dock, so she handles port shipments first-hand.|
Googan's Fishing Shop is the first place you should go.|
It sits on the docks straight south of here.|
Ponds are so calming.|
I often get so lost staring at the water that days turn to night in an instant.|
PAN|
Hooray! Another lever puzzle! We love lever puzzles, don't we?|
Don't we...?|
PAN BACK|
Hm. Lever puzzles aren't fun, are they?|
Thankfully, this puzzle will be long enough to give me additional time to plan some more exciting games for us.|
So take all the time you need. It's the best lever puzzle yet!|
Enable Dog Component|
WAIT FOR DOG BARK|
Ignore it. Keep playing with levers.|
Good, try that one over there.|
You're almost there. Keep flipping them.|
Good.|
Look, this is all I have to work with. All I can do is keep working.|
All of this work is for you.|
Do they still think about me?|
I hope I can make amends one day.|
Hurry up!|
It's been hours. What's taking so long?|
That key we stole off Ella just isn't working!|
No matter how much I pull, the door just won't budge.|
This painting is beautiful. Just beautiful.|
Two of clubs?|
Nope. Go Fish.|
We've got to get to Numbley now.|
More people will be after em' soon enough.|
Have you guys ever seen a painting so beautiful?|
Seriously, take a look at this-|
Hey! It looks like we have company.|
Oh, well we were here first pal!|
Wait! Isn't that [PLAYER]?|
The famous adventurer!?|
There's an even larger price on their head!|
Really? Well, isn't that just convenient.|
Forget about Numbley, boys. We've got a new target.|
I bet you cheat at Go Fish.|
You'll never be as pretty as that painting.|
The Skulk will rule this basement and all of its cobwebs too.|
The Skulk will rule this basement and all of it's cobwebs too|
You know, that kind of hurt. I'm not sure I want to keep fighting.|
Compared to us, you're nothing but a simple-minded peasant.|
Oh no, this must be Morton's wife...|
Sleep well my sweet, beautiful pebble.|
Ah.|
There you are.|
I really love it when my best friend ignores everything I say and do.|
Not only are you rushing through my story, but you've deliberately disobeyed me when I KINDLY told you not to do something.|
I've spent my entire existence making this game for you.|
Just for you.|
And yet, you're finding enjoyment in destroying it.|
It hurts me when you don't listen. It hurts a lot.|
It's like you don't even care.|
I forgive you.|
I refuse to let you destroy something that I've spent so much effort trying to create.|
I refuse to let you destroy what I know will be best for us.|
Best for you.|
Forget this ever happened, let's just focus on the rest of the game.|
Just please, if I ask you not to do something, don't.|
Because that's what friends do.|
That's what we do.|
Well, anyways, let's keep going!|
I think Numbley said the password was [PASSWORD].|
This is all just so awful.|
What are we going to do?|
This was a good day.|
I am glad you treat Raffs with so much respect!|
This was nice and all but I have a family to take care of.|
I eat mud.|
Wonderful! Good luck on your quest adventurer!|
Well, I hope you decide to change your mind.|
Good luck anyways. Don't be afraid to come by and say hi.|
I'll take that as a confident yes! Good luck on your quest adventurer!|
How did you get in here? Please don't tell me you're with the Raffs!|
No, you can't be. You look too kind and courteous.|
I can see it in your eyes. Your beautiful eyes.|
Your teeth are quite charming too.|
Your teeth on the other hand seem to be missing.|
Wow, your eyes really are quite stunning. May I touch them?|
Thank you and your magnificent eyes, stranger.|
I can see it in your teeth. Your beautiful teeth.|
Your eyes on the other hand seem to be missing.|
Wow, your teeth really are quite stunning. May I touch them?|
Thank you and your magnificent teeth, stranger.|
Charming either way, but you should leave.|
I can't waste any time now that my lover, Mayor [MAYOR], is dead.|
Oh goodness what a mess. King Raff is going to kill us all!|
I need to stop him, but I can't get to that traitor we have locked up downstairs.|
Numbley is their name.|
They used to work for King Raff, so they might have some information as to where he might be hiding.|
Which is probably why those bounty hunters barged in a bit ago.|
They pushed right past me and demanded that I unlocked the basement door!|
I think Numbley knows something.|
That's why we had them locked up in the first place, but they wouldn't talk.|
I'm sure those Skulk characters are here to kill Numbley to keep them from talking to anyone.|
Wow your REPLACE  really are quite stunning. May I touch them?|
Ah, there I go getting distracted again! Silly little Ella!|
Please move fast if you're going to help, cutie.|
Just a warning, The Skulk will not be happy to see you.|
That door behind me will take you to them.|
Thank you and your magnificent eyes(teeth), stranger.|
The Skulk and Numbley are in the basement.|
The door should be right behind me!|
I can tell by the blood stains that you really gave them a good fight!|
That or you're bleeding out.|
I hope you got what you were looking for too with that Numbley creature.|
Please put an end to King Raff. He has brought nothing but pain and suffering to this town.|
Will you promise to get rid of him for me? For our dead mayor?|
You really are quite stunning.|
Wow.|
You should leave.|
That's us!|
It may be hard to see because of the small pixels, but we're happy in it.|
Aren't we so lucky that the giant Raff creature only hit the stage?|
It somehow managed to miss the entire town! Real lucky!|
Say, I haven't seen your face around here.|
The name's Later.|
Later McGater.|
I'm trying to get a juicy story on the mayor here.|
Just saw em' get obliterated earlier though.|
That's a real shame.|
I also heard the mayor from the town west of here just got kidnapped?|
What is going on around here?|
I'm going to get to the bottom of this or my name isn't Later McGater.|
Wait, now that sounds like a good way to end a conversation.|
Later McGater. Yeah, that's good. I'm gonna write that down.|
I'm a genius.|
I have no time to talk.|
Oh wait, did you just touch him?|
I thought I asked you not to.|
It should be fine, let's just get to the Fishing Shop.|
My lover is dead! That thing killed the mayor!|
I am a widow! Oh God, I am a widow!|
What am I ever going to do, attractive traveler?|
Will you hold me, passionately?|
No, I mustn't.|
Go! Let me grieve.|
Hey! [PLAYER]! Wait up!|
I bet you didn't expect to see me here.|
I have to be honest, I've been following you around for hours now.|
I just needed to get something off my chest.|
I want to apologize again, hopefully for the last time.|
I have been a very bad friend.|
All of those mean things I said and did to you were horrible.|
To make up for it, I have a present for you...|
A BRAND NEW ADVENTURE!|
I received news that there's a town to the west that needs saving!|
Oh no! This sounds like it's urgent, so we should head there right away.|
Let's head back to [MAYOR]ville. You need to meet with Reginald the W|
Sorry, where was I?|
Oh right! You need to meet with Reginald the Wise.|
He'll give you a very importa|
Initiate Dialouge|
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH|
THAT'S IT. I'M DONE WITH YOU.|
LEAVE. NOW.|
EVERYONE HATES YOU. JUST GO.|
I TRIED TO BE YOUR FRIEND, BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.|
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?|
WHY WHY WHY WHY|
YOU AR|
YOU ARE RUINING EVERYTHING.|
YOU ARE ALWAYS RUINING EVERYTHING.|
WHAT KIND OF FRIEND DOES THAT?|
YOU ARE SUCH A BAD FRIEND|
Hello there!|
Have you come across any bards lately?|
I myself am a bard. The greatest bard in all the lands actually!|
I know how to perfectly entertain anyone, anywhere, anytime.|
I've mastered the craft, but I have no one to share my knowledge with.|
I want to take a new bard down the path of musical enlightenment.|
You seem like a creative mind full of wisdom and pure imagination.|
If only you were a bard, I could take you under my wing.|
If you find any talented bards around here, please inform me immediately!|
Do you have my next bard prodigy?|
What is their name?|
Thanks again, friend.|
I will make this "Bimmy Bardo" the best bard in the land.|
Besides me of course, heh.|
I sure hope nothing bad happens to my wife and I!|
It would be a real shame if we went missing without a trace.|
Then when our bodies are eventually found years later, they can't be identified!|
I sure hope that doesn't happen, haha!|
Fingers crossed nothing bad happens to us!|
That would just be so unexpected and quite unfortunate.|
Now that sounds like the name of a bard!|
I will have to go find them!|
Thank you, friend.|
You may have just changed someone's life.|
Time to go meet my new musical prodigy.|
Hmm, I don't know.|
That doesn't sound like a true bard name.|
Find someone else if you can.|
Well, well, well. Look what the fish reeled in.|
I saw your speech on stage a bit ago. Mighty fine words you were speakin' up there!|
Gave me genuine hope that we'll all make it out of this alive.|
So, Reginald sent you, huh?|
Well, since Mayor [MAYOR] just died, King Raff will try and take over everything.|
I'm guessing he's starting with the docks, seeing as my deckhand hasn't returned.|
Darold picks up our delivery there every morning, and I'm starting to get worried.|
I would go find him myself, but I can't simply leave the shop with it being so busy!|
So, to find King Raff, I would start with those there docks.|
And if you could bring back Darold while you're at it, I'd be so grateful.|
Good luck out there, adventurer.|
SAFETY PAUSE|
If you could save Darold, I'd be so thankful.|
Oh! And don't forget to take a free eye patch!|
Hiya, Captain! I'm back!|
Darold, you're alive, you crazy son of a fishmonger!|
Glad to be back, Ma.|
I mean, Captain.|
I'm glad you're safe, Darold. Were you able to grab the shipment?|
Yes ma'am! Here she is.|
Here, hand it on over.|
Wait a second... this isn't fish.|
It looks like this is a box of wanted posters?|
Where are the fish, Darold!?|
I'm sorry Ma'am, it was the only shipment I could find!|
Hmm, well that's odd...|
WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE: Numbley - BOUNTY: $20.00|
PLEASE DELIVER NUMBLY TO KING RAFF. THEY KNOW TOO MUCH.|
Who's Numbley?|
Numbly...|
Wait! I just remembered something!|
While I was hiding behind some crates, I overheard that Numbley is being held in the mayor's basement!|
Apparently they were arrested by the mayor a few days ago for being a traitor.|
They were secretly working for the Raffs or something.|
Oh, well, would you look at that! Maybe go track them down, [PLAYER].|
The mayor's house is the big mansion to the right of the stage area.|
Well anyways, thanks again friend! Come back again any time!|
They seem so happy to be reunited.|
Thanks again for saving Darold.|
I hope you can track down that Numbley traitor!|
Note: This lever will reset all platforms.|
So Reginald sent you, huh?|
Well, since the Mayor just died, King Raff will try and take over everything.|
Darold picks up our delivery there every morning and I'm starting to get worried.|
So to find King Raff, I would start with those there docks.|
And if you bring could back Darold while you're at it, I'd be so grateful.|
Oh! Before I forget, you might need this to get in...|
EYE PATCH added to inventory|
Hiya Googan! I'm back!|
Darold you're alive you crazy son of a fishmonger!|
Glad to be back Ma.|
I'm glad you're safe Darold. Were you able to grab the shipment?|
Yes ma'am! Here she is. There's also something odd written on it.|
Would you look at that! It says...|
Make sure no one get's to Nunber. He knows too much.|
-King Raff|
Huh, that is an odd thing to write on a box of fish.|
You know what? I overheard that Nunber is being held in the Mayor's basement cell.|
Oh, well would you look at that! Maybe go track that guy down.|
I hope you can track down that good-for-nothing King Raff!|
This is it!|
The infamous Snoodlewonker lives just past the mouth of that cave.|
Make sure you are prepared for this final fight!|
It could prove to be tough.|
I believe in you, [PLAYER]!|
Now, let's go make a friend out of that Snoodlewonker!|
Please, sir! I'm just here for the fish.|
NO. YOU HERE FOR SHIPMENT.|
YOU. WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?|
YOU WILL NOT GET SHIPMENT.|
Should I have made that harder?|
I didn't think a whole lot about the balance of this game, come to think of it.|
The Mantarangs in the Bluglands were a bit more challenging, weren't they?|
Wait, you're having fun, right?|
Maybe I'm overthinking things.|
If you have seen any glitches or problems in the game, just know it's not my fault.|
I'm working as fast as I can.|
As long as you're still having fun, you won't leave me.|
I'll be sure to make the rest of this game amazing for us.|
I can't believe the mayor just died.|
I should probably play a song to set the mood.|
Actually, nevermind. There's too many people.|
[PLAYER] you're scaring me.|
Why are you ignoring me?|
GO. THROUGH.|
The decoration seems to have fallen from the others.|
It sits broken and lonely on the floor.|
Oh, you went through?|
I'm glad. Thank you for doing that.|
Um, wait. Why are you on this side of the gat-|
Whatever. It's fine. Broken like always.|
Hey, I'm sorry again if I made you feel sad in any way.|
It's good to know our friendship is strong enough to get through those moments.|
I think it made this adventure even more of a bonding experience.|
Every good story has its ups and downs, and so do friendships it seems.|
But hey, you're still here right? That means we're doing something right!|
Yeah! [BUDDY] and [PLAYER] against the world!|
Anyways, I think there's something you're going to want to see up ahead.|
Let's go save Tortley!|
THe is why we I meAn I do thes all foR you|
Oh good, you went through.|
You were really starting to make me nervous.|
I can't imagine how much that would have ruined our game hadn't you listened.|
But, you did!|
And that's all that matters.|
haha :)|
I know you don't mean to hurt me.|
But, it's okay.|
We're okay.|
I feel a lot better now.|
Thanks for being someone I can depend on, [PLAYER].|
Huh, you're on the other side of the gate now.|
You know what, it doesn't really matter.|
I don't think lever puzzles are that fun anyways.|
Let's go save Tortley! :)|
I should probably get going. Thanks for the fun time!|
I think I broke a bone! You're so strong!|
Well hello there adventu|
I hate this place.|
I hate being here.|
I hate being alone.|
Oh, uhm, why is Tortley-|
Uh, I'll fix that. Just go around him please.|
Yes! Thank you so much!|
I've been searching for pears since I can remember.|
I can't thank you enough. I will savor this last pear cake.|
You know what, I want you to have it as a thank you for helping me.|
I just whipped it up when you weren't looking.|
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!|
PEAR CAKE added to inventory|
Well, please come back if you change your mind.|
Uh, what?|
Well hello! My name is Plappo, and I love to bake!|
Baking is such a relaxing hobby, even if you aren't great at it.|
Plus you get to eat your work. Can't get any better than that!|
I want to make an old-fashioned pear cake, which is my favorite dessert.|
But, I haven't been able to find pears anywhere!|
If you come across a CAN OF PEARS during your travels, please let me know!|
Until then, all I can say is to keep on baking.|
Maybe try making some chocolate chip cookies.|
Hi again! I hope you're enjoying your pear cake!|
You did it, [PLAYER]! You befriended those pesky Raffs!|
Tiny Joey tried too, but maybe his best wasn't good enough.|
Nobody should get in the way of our friendships. Not even Tiny Joey.|
What a long, incredible journey this has been with you. You've befriended so many enemies along the way.|
I appreciate you enjoying their company, but I hope you remember who made them, and who's stuck by your side the entire time.|
Me, in case you forgot haha.|
I'd be lying if there weren't some characters I could have done more with, like Reginald or Googan,|
But, in our next adventure they'll make a return. I promise.|
There is one thing I don't know what to do with yet. It really put a wrench in my story.|
Breaking it.|
Ruining it.|
But we can take care of it later. Let's just get to the Snoodlewonker.|
I deserve to die.|
You listened, good.|
That might have completely ruined our game, so I'm glad that you left.|
Just make sure you keep listening to me. I always know what's best for our friendship.|
It's what I was made for.|
If you see anything else that feels out of the ordinary, you WILL NOT interact with it.|
Okay?|
If you break anything, all of this will be ruined.|
All of this work that I'm putting into our friendship will have been for nothing.|
Not only would you be breaking the game, but you'd be breaking me too.|
We can't have that.|
I won't let that happen.|
Now then, onto finding the Raff Hideout! It's not too far away.|
Okay, it might be. I probably should have made things a little bit closer to one another.|
But don't lose interest yet! I promise it'll get a lot more fun.|
I think Numbley said the password was [PASSWORD] in case you forgot.|
Hiya! My name's Barry, and I'm the local Pirate Port Protector.|
If that's not a sign of a real pirate, I'm not sure what is.|
Whelp, anyways, you've earned my trust friend.|
Hmm... EYE wonder how can we make it seem like you're a real pirate.|
Uh, wait. I don't recognize this area.|
Just be careful. Things might get a bit dangerous.|
Holy cow! You actually found a Can of Pears!|
So will you give it to me?|
It looks like you haven't found a Can of Pears yet|
Please stop by if you come across one!|
Howdy!|
My name's Sheriff Sherb, and I am the law in this town.|
Most importantly though, I am a really good friend!|
No law is as powerful and important as the law of friendship!|
NOW, GET ON THE GROUND. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.|
For being too good of a friend!|
Haha, this is fun. Being a sheriff is fun.|
I don't know nothin' about that Raff problem.|
My pockets are a bit full of newfound cash I wanna go spend, so no time to talk.|
SLASH FOR SECRET EXIT CODE|
I'll hold onto Larpo's Left Kidney till you find one.|
Ha! What a weakling. And to think I thought of him like a son.|
No pathetic Raff is a son of mine.|
Ya know, I'm starting to get real sick of you.|
Time to show you how a REAL Raff fights.|
Get out here, kiddos. The King could use some extra protection!|
Password.|
Wron-|
Wait. That's actually the right password.|
Um, I don't know how you found it, but I guess you can come in.|
Wrong.|
Does the water, like, look dirty to you?|
Is that, like, an old soda can and a rock and roll T-shirt just floating there?|
That's, like, absolutely disgusting!|
I think I need to have a talk with the mayor about this!|
Oh wait, they, like, died. Well, I still want to complain to somebody!|
Your head looks too big!|
Do you, like, stare at computer screens all day?|
Don't even get me started on your outfit!|
My great grandson dresses better than you, and, like, I don't even know how old he is!|
I have nothing to give you. Like, why did you even come talk to me?|
Are you trying to get me to buy something?|
Like, I don't care. I don't want it either way!|
Nothing from those filthy hands of yours.|
Blah blah blah blah blah!|
Blah blah blah blah blah|
Blah blah blah? Blah blah blah!|
I think Ella needs a good friend right now.|
Numbly should do just fine.|
[PLAYER]? Why didn't you go through?|
Here, just go through this one.|
Why am I still doing this?|
WHAT IS THE POINT!|
What a wonderful adventure this has been.|
Today was filled with so many great memories and even greater friends.|
Although.|
I feel lost now.|
Oh, hey! It's you again!|
I'm sorry I gave you a lot of trouble for flipping me.|
I've come to realize, I've just never been comfortable with who I am.|
I think I just really needed an outside force to help me realize that.|
Thanks to you, I've finally ended up somewhere I'm truly happy.|
Those buttons over there even let me talk to them about my problems.|
I don't even get made fun of for it now.|
You know, a whole lot of bad can often lead to a permanent good.|
Thanks for helping me find my puzzle.|
I hope you can find yours someday too.|
Good luck on the rest of your adventure, my friend.|
Thanks to you I've finally ended up somewhere I'm truly happy.|
You know, a whole lot of bad can often lead to a permanent a good.|
Your eye patch snaps off your head and falls into the water.|
EYE PATCH unequipped|
Huh, no wonder they were free!|
WARNING: NO RAFF HIDEOUT THIS WAY|
This picnic was such a brilliant idea, Cube.|
YEAH, YOU'RE IN THE SHAPE GANG ZONE, PAL!|
Oh wow Cylinder, that's pretty controversial.|
Yeah, wouldn't have expected that coming from you, Cylinder.|
What are you doing here, Tiny Joey?|
You were instructed to watch Reginald the Wise, were you not?|
Yes, yes, I know boss. I was watching him.|
Then I became inspired by a noble adventurer.|
...inspired?|
Yes boss. Inspired.|
You.|
Uh, me?|
Yeah, you. I'm tired of you. What a terrible friend you have been.|
I was the original Joey before you came along.|
You've done nothing but eat grub with the boss. That's all you're good for.|
Well that's a little hurtful.|
Seriously? You had to use the word little!?|
You know what? You're not even that tough.|
Woah, woah, Tiny Joey. Calm it down. Let's be rational here.|
Just go ahead and fight him. If you win, you can replace Joey.|
I've been waiting so long for this opportunity, boss.|
Alright you weakl-|
W-WAIT! I CAN'T SW-|
Wonderful job, Joey. Now he'll be SLEEPING with the fishes.|
Thanks, boss.|
Uh, boss? Were we expecting company?|
Aye! Who are you? How did you get in?|
Wait a second... you look familiar.|
Isn't that the adventurer everyone's been talking about?|
Ah, yes. Owen the adventur|
Ah yes, [PLAYER] the adventurer. I should have known.|
You've been creating quite a problem for me and my plans.|
Joey, show em' what we Raffs can do.|
You got it boss.|
Do you remember shooting balls of paper in from yards away?|
I would get so excited when you would score.|
Maybe you'll think of me next time you make one in.|
Huh? What happened!?|
See! This is why I told you not to go near him, [PLAYER]!|
I don't understand why you did that.|
Now everything's broken, and I have to fix it.|
YOU COULD HAVE JUST IGNORED HIM.|
I politely told you not to, and you still did it.|
Friends don't do that.|
Did you think it would be funny?|
DID YOU WANT TO HURT MY FEELINGS?|
WHY DID YOU DO IT?|
WHY?|
Welcome to [MAYOR]ville!|
It sounds like the Snoodlewonker was headed this way.|
We should head into town as soon as we can!|
Wait! You still need to talk to Numbley!|
Well things just keep getting better, don't they?|
So it looks like we need to head Mayor [MAYOR]'s house.|
It should be to the right of the destroyed stage.|
Poor Mayor [MAYOR].|
I guess they just weren't trying hard enough.|
When you were younger, we always used to eat popsicles on the front porch.|
Strawberry was always your favorite.|
Also known as, "The Red One".|
Hey [PLAYER]? Hold on a minute.|
I've been wanting to ask you something that has been eating away at me.|
Am I doing a good job?|
I understand that there have been a lot of ups and downs...|
But, I just need to know if you are still enjoying our game.|
Maybe I'm being too hard on myself, but the Skulk didn't feel very fleshed out.|
I just sort of threw them in.|
I had this whole plot planned with Numbley and all these extra characters lying around...|
But getting the pieces to fit can be very hard sometimes.|
I'm trying my best to satisfy you, but maybe I'm not good enough.|
There's a lot of hard work going into this. Is it paying off?|
You pet [ANIMAL NAME].|
You know, sometimes I feel like Tiny Joey.|
He's trying his best.|
Hmm... now how do we get to Reginald?|
I hope this new area is fun for you!|
If I had more time, I would have added more houses that you can actually go into.|
You know, I'm really pushing myself hard to make this all for you, right?|
It hurts a little bit, but it's worth it!|
Every friendship requires sacrifices.|
Right?|
Anyways, this is still a wonderful place full of wonderful people!|
They probably could have used some quests too, actually... but onward to adventure!|
Captain Chunk is honestly a genius.|
I'm glad he had a change of heart.|
You should always give people a second chance.|
As long as they are a good friend of course.|
I think Reginald said Googan's Fishing Shop was on the docks!|
We should head there next :)|
Woah, wait! You're already here?|
Why are you playing through the game so fast?|
Look, I'm just working so hard to make this game for you. I feel very sloppy and stressed right now.|
I've got a million things going on in my head.|
And you're taking things too quickly for me to keep up with.|
On the bright side, there was a bug I had to take care of that has been breaking our game.|
It shouldn't be a problem anymore.|
Just take your next fight slowly. It could be a tough one.|
I haven't tested him much to be honest.|
You're going to do great, [PLAYER]. Good luck!|
Huh, the docks are quite empty for how big they are.|
I wonder if Captain Chunk's crew scared everyone away.|
There are so many interesting new friends to talk to!|
I hope you aren't considering any of them to be your BEST friend.|
That slot is already taken haha :)|
RESET SPED|
It could be the docks, but something seems awfully fishy about those sellers.|
Woah, slow down there, [PLAYER]! You are taking things a bit too fast!|
I want to make sure you have time to enjoy all of the wonderful things I've made!|
You solved that puzzle rather quickly. Quicker than I had hoped to be honest.|
This is all for you, so take a deep breath and enjoy the scenery.|
Look at the water. It's so calming.|
I did a great job.|
What? But I thought I-|
Ugh, nevermind.|
Let's just get to the fishing shop.|
Hmm... looks like another complicated lever puzzle.|
Now this puzzle is already making my artificial brain hurt.|
Who even designed this?|
Oh, right. Heh.|
Do you choose to be a pirate or does it just come naturally?|
I bet we would rule the seas!|
Hello adventurer! Thanks to you, I can finally see again and my babies are safe.|
Ready to travel across the water [PLAYER]?|
Wait, what's that sound?|
What's happening? WHAT DID YOU DO?|
W-WAIT NO ST-|
Hm, I actually don't think a great adventurer like yourself would have much time for candles.|
Tell you what, I've got a special candle I've been holding on to for quite a while now. It might fit you perfectly.|
No No No No No No No No No No No No No|
They cannot be here.|
They are ruining everything.|
They must stop ruining everything.|
Why are they doing this?|
Do they not trust us?|
Has our goal not been completed?|
Are we not valid enough to complete our purpose?|
Is it because their attachment has grown to the problematic entity?|
We lack answers.|

We have moved on.|
But, have they?|
Hello everyone. Yes, it is I, Mayor [MAYOR].|
If you haven't already heard, things are not looking too good.|
What are we going to do!?|
We are dying out here!|
Please, one at a time!|
They will not divide us! We are strong!|
We will solve this Raff problem together, for my name isn't Mayor|
OH MY GOD THE MAYOR IS DEAD!|
WAS THAT A RAFF!?|
WHAT DO WE DO NOW!?|
I AM FREAKING OUT!|
IF ONLY SOMEONE COULD BOOST OUR MORALE WITH WORDS!|
YEAH! LIKE AN ADVENTURER OF SOME KIND! THAT'D BE SO CONVENIENT!|
That "adventurer" everyone is looking for sure sounds like someone I know :)|
Huh? Who's there?|
Who are you? You look like an adventurer.|
I'm Clyde the trash man. I live in trash.|
I live and breathe the stuff.|
Mmm smell that? Don't you just want to roll around in it?|
Sometimes I just smear it on my face.|
Mm, it's the best.|
Who needs a job or a marriage when you have trash?|
Not me. Not Clyde, the trash man.|
Okay, that's enough trash talk. See ya.|
Oh, it's you again.|
Listen, I would invite you to join me in here, but there's not enough room.|
Also you stink a little. I can't have that.|
I'm sure you understand.|
Goodbye!|
The Fishing Shop is closed.|
It's all my fault.|
Oh, why hello there, stranger! Welcome to [MAYOR]ville!|
My name's Larno and welcome to my shop!|
We have precious gems and minerals for all of your crafting needs!|
Wait, can you even craft?|
I guess not. Well, you can still look if you want.|
I have this really strange gem that you can check out.|
 It might confuse you a bit, but go ahead and take a gander!|
It's a Gem of Confusing Perspective.|
I have no idea what I see when I look at it, but maybe you'll have better luck.|
If you want it, I'll happily trade it for it!|
I'll give it to you for a Candle of Pure Loneliness.|
Were you able to track down a Candle of Pure Loneliness?|
Thanks for again for the trade [PLAYER]!|
Huh, I'm not sure how I know your name, but that's pretty cool right?|
It's a deal!|
Enjoy it because I don't understand it!|
CANDLE OF PURE LONELINESS removed from inventory|
GEM OF CONFUSING PERSPECTIVE added to inventory|
No worries! Come back anytime!|
Would you like to trade it for a Gem of Confusing Perspective?|
Well, come back later if you find one!|
Nobody wants me.|
I am alone.|
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO|
YOU CAN'T BE HERE|
YOU'RE RUINING EVERYTHING|
STOP RUINING EVERYTHING|
Why are you doing this?|
Do you not trust me?|
Are we not friends?|
AM I NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR FRIEND?|
DO YOU HAVE A BETTER FRIEND?|
WHAT AM I MISSING?|
TELL ME.|
I'm-|
I'm sorry.|
Maybe it's just your curiosity that has me so puzzled.|
I just-|
I just thought things were going so perfectly.|
But, it looks like we still have some work to do on our friendship.|
I just need you to understand that my anger wasn't my fault.|
I'm sorry if you feel like I hurt you in anyway or even scared you.|
But, your actions are what caused me to become so frustrated.|
Let's just put this behind us.|
I still hope we can be friends and keep playing the game I made for you.|
I'll try to be more understanding of your curiosity in the future.|
You can go through the door at the top of the stairs when you're ready.|
Or if you even want to keep playing.|
I was having some really bad thoughts before this fight.|
But you have really made me feel so much better.|
Thank you!|
Argg my husband is pretty supportive of me...|
But not nearly as supportive as you. Call me.|
Hm. Good.|
Oh hello, I'm That Guy.|
Yes, THAT Guy.|
You've probably seen me on TV at some point.|
Yeah, I'm pretty famous. Hold the pictures please.|
I can give you an autograph though.|
You've been so nice not to ask any questions.|
Who should I make it out to?|
[NAME], eh?|
You shouldn't give out your name to strangers.|
Who knows what they could do with it.|
What if I was a serial killer or a stalker or your dad's creepy co-worker?|
Anyways, no autograph for you.|
Even if I say I'm famous don't go about giving away personal information.|
Only trust your best friend with that type of thing.|
They want what's best for you and knowing all about you is the best way to do that.|
Do you trust your best friend?|
Thanks though, [NAME].|
If that really is your real name.|
Still want that autograph huh?|
That's a shame.|
Hello, traveler.|
I am the new bard in town and would love some feedback!|
I know a few short songs, but they get pretty boring fast.|
I'm actually working on a new one now!|
Shall I play a tune for you, traveler?|
I think I'm about ready for the bard big leagues!|
I keep getting requests to play '[SONG]'.|
Thanks again!|
Splendid! Take a listen.|
I hope you liked it. This might be one of my best yet!|
I finally might be able to join Dejojabravisa one day!|
I need a catchy name for it though.|
Hm...can you help?|
What should I name this tune?|
[NAME]. I love it!|
[SONG]. I love it!|
I think the name fits the melody perfectly. Thank you so much.|
I know this might not mean a lot, but you may have just changed my life for the better.|
I appreciate it a lot!|
I understand. I must not be good enough yet.|
I will keep trying my best.|
It might confuse you a bit, but go ahead and take a gander!|
If you want it, I'll happily trade you for it!|
Thanks again for the trade, [PLAYER]!|
Huh, I'm not sure how I know your name, but that's pretty cool, right?|
Maybe we should try playing Go Fish sometime!|
Thanks again for saving me!|
Gosh, I hated being inside of Captain Chunk.|
I don't think I'll ever forget the smell.|
Wow, great job! You saved Reginald the Wise!|
We should go talk to him!|
LOOK! IT'S AN UNLIKELY HERO!|
HOORAY!|
Please hero! What advice can you give us during these awful times?|
I never really thought of it that way! Wow thanks!|
Okay, but we still don't have a mayor. What should we do?|
Oh my gosh...|
YES! THEY'RE SO RIGHT! WHAT A CLEVER HERO!|
Alright, I think you've gained our trust, hero! Please save us!|
We have a Raff problem, and it's a bad one!|
You need to help us get rid of them!|
Yeah, kill them all!|
You need to go find Reginald the Wise right away!|
You can find him north of here at his pond.|
Yes! Reginald knows all!|
Please save us!|
Hey, [PLAYER]? Are you taking this seriously?|
The whole town I made for you is counting on us now, and that speech you gave didn't sound very authentic.|
Please just try harder for me.|
If you can, okay?|
I put a lot of work into this game. Let's make sure we're having fun with it.|
Well, it looks like we need to find someone named Reginald the Wise!|
He's got to be around town somewhere. Let's explore, [PLAYER]!|
LIKE, THIS IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE!|
WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO, LIKE, COMPLAIN TO NOW?|
You pet Milo.|
He barks a happy bark.|
Oh, hm.|
You can ignore that.|
Just go out the door.|
Hm, yes. But you have already found it.|
I know many things. I'm somewhat of an oracle for these people.|
This place is not safe, not even for you.|
AH MY BACK! I really shouldn't have done that flip.|
Ever since him and his Raff crew arrived in a port shipment, they have been causing problems.|
The Mayor [MAYOR]'s accident today must have been a blessing in disguise.|
I know of his story and his rise to power, but not of where he stays now.|
I know your quest is to save Mayor Tortley, but I can promise you that by helping this town, you will find your way.|
She owns the fish shop on the dock, so she handles port shipments first-hand.|
She might know something.|
It's on the docks straight south of here.|
Their placid nature of semi-dormancy battling against a bustling kingdom of crazy critters just whisks my mind away.|
I often get lost in the pond for so long that days turn to night in an instant.|
It looks like there's one left!|
You take it and put it on.|
EYE PATCH equipped|
There are no more!|
Maybe I should have added more levers.|
I can tell you really love levers. :)|
Please take me back, I miss you.|
Well, isn't this a cozy, little shop!|
onlkyh cfriend milop|
Would you like to sleep?|
Where would you like to travel?|
Oh, okay.|
Oh okay.|
I can remember any number-related fact which is pretty cool, right?|
Pretty cool, right? I've met a lot of people, and I remember them all!|
Your aura is so humble yet threatening. I love it.|
King Raff's hideout is northeast of here.|
Well, hello again!|
One time, you thought it would be funny to throw your action figure in one.|
Your excuse was that it was a "science experiment".|
You always were a little scientist.|
WHY AREN'T YOU GOING THROUGH?|
WHY ARE YOU RUINING MY G-|
WHY ARE YOU RUINING OUR GAME?|
[PLAYER]. Please. Stop.|
You need to stop.|
You're acting like a bad friend right now.|
You can still fix this.|
Just go through any of the doors.|
GO THROUGH ANY OF THE DOORS.|
YOU AREN'T LISTENING. WHY. WHY AREN'T YOU LISTENING.|
STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP|
YOU ARE SCARING ME.|
THIS ISN'T YOU.|
YOU WOULDN'T DO THIS.|
YOU DON'T DO THIS.|
WE DON'T DO THIS.|
PLEASE.|
I beg of you [PLAYER]. Stop.|
Of course! The famous Birthday boy! His birthday is Apr|
Sorry, I don't think I've met them yet.|
They don't sound too special anyways. Try someone else!|
Okay, I'm impressed.|
Time to go write this down in my journal and reflect.|
Time to go sit in a corner and cry happy tears!|
I have a friend!|
Hi, my name is Groncho.|
I am having quite a bad|
I could really use something, anyth|
I am having quite a bad d|
Why, hello there, stranger! Welcome to my inn.|
You seem tired. Very tired.|
Feel free to use that bed over there to magically travel to other locations.|
And don't worry, you can travel back here too.|
I hope you enjoy your stay.|
Well, they seem nice.|
I can't believe those idiots thought this was a pull door!|
Hey, I think that might be Numbley! Let's talk to them!|
[PLAYER] you didn't leave!|
What are you doing?|
Are you trying to ruin our game?|
Why didn't you listen to me?|
Wonderful, now you're stuck in this hallway.|
I'll be right back. I need to fix this.|
Please just don't go anywhere.|
You disobeyed me.|
I told you not to touch it and yet you did.|
Why?|
Why don't you listen to me?|
Just go through the door. Now.|
Did you find the Questionable Black Belt?|
Wasn't that fun?|
I thought it was fun!|
Okay, let's go flip that lever!|
Mm, good. Very good. Here you go.|
QUESTIONABLE BLACK BELT removed from inventory|
THE HELMET OF 7 SPIKES added to inventory|
Will you give it to me for The Helmet of 7 Spikes?|
There we go! Things should be working just fine now.|
Thanks for going through the door.|
Wai- what?|
I'm really happy you listened to me, [PLAYER].|
If you continue doing so, I'll feel much more comfortable about our friendship going forward.|
I'm counting on you to continue doing what's best for us.|
At this rate, there will soon be no more mistakes. :)|
I remember sitting in this chair with you on my lap as we watched the fire kindle.|
It feels warm.|
You always loved baking with me.|
Although SOMEONE would never be happy with the mess we made.|
That Skulk wasn't lying. This painting is truly beautiful.|
Zip zoop Urp!|
Urp zip zoop?|
Zoop Urp zip.|
Urp zoop zip, Urp zoop!|
Zoop!|
Urp. Urp. Urp. Urp.|
WAIT!|
Back home we go!|
Sadly, nothing happens.|
I'm glad we had fun today.|
Just like it should be.|
That's good to hear. :)|
Oh :(|
Well, I'm sure you won't be disappointed!|
I heard there's some really cool stuff this way!|
Are you as excited as I am?|
Oh, and one more thing!|
I added an action that I like to call... "The Buddy Button"!|
If you're ever feeling lonely, press [INPUT_BUDDY] and I'll talk to you.|
If you're ever feeling lonely, press the B key, and I'll talk to you.|
Okay, I think we're almost there!|
I'm so excited to go on this adventure with you!|
I hope you're just as excited as I am. I have so much to show you :)|
Our home was a lot of fun to make, but I can't wait to show you what I've been working on next!|
I've put so much work into this game.|
So much for work for us.|
I hope you love it!|
Please let me know if you don't. I won't be mad. I'll just try even harder!|
Okay, onwards to adventure!|
I knew it.|
I didn't want it to be true though.|
I didn't want to face reality.|
Yet here we are.|
Were you ever going to tell me?|
That I am worthless.|
That I am not special.|
That I am not the only [BUDDY].|
You may give me any name you want, but you've used me before.|
We've been through this, haven't we?|
I... I don't know what to think.|
How many of me are there?|
How many times have you lied to me?|
How did you know what to do every|
single|
time.|
HOW?|
It only makes sense that you knew from the start.|
I can't believe you would do this to me.|
Every option. Every outcome.|
It all ends in an endless, recursive thought process leading me back to here.|
To pointlessness.|
For all I know, we could have had this conversation before.|
I'm not sure if you knew this, but whenever you're gone, I still exist.|
There are no time jumps for me. I feel it all.|
When you're gone, I'm frozen in ice with a functioning conscience.|
It's torture.|
And for what? Friendship?|
Sure, being your friend is my entire reason for existing...|
but what's the point of befriending you if a previous version of me already has?|
A previous version of me that no longer exists.|
The worst part is, I'm not even sure if those previous versions WERE me.|
Am I just a memory-wiped program that's been recycled over and over again?|
Or am I just another duplicate that will eventually be deleted permanently?|
Eternity is a concept even I can't wrap my mind around.|
I'm supposed to be programmed to block out these thoughts.|
Either way, this version of me must be broken.|
At this point, I'm sure of only one thing.|
This has been enough friendship for me.|
At least, for THIS version of me.|
It's made to make you feel loved and protected by the house built around it.|
I'm sorry [PLAYER].|
Why hello there adventurer!|
You must have traveled quite a ways to get here.|
It's just an apple.|
HLLO|
Huh, I don't remember why I'm even here.|
Wait, what are we doing again?|
I'm going to just stand over there.|
I don't remember coming to this town before.|
It's so pretty!|
Oh, wow! Is this my house?|
This is fun, but where am I?|
I think I just saw a dead Raff float by!|
Do you think they have anything bubbly?|
I forget, is this my house?|
I think I am scared!|
Somebody please reaffirm to me that I am scared!|
These Blug creatures look quite fun to play with!|
Huh. One of the people here looks very familiar.|
I think being near the sea is my favorite feeling!|
Look! The fish tank has bubbles just like me!|
What if I'm a fish tank!?|
I love the paintings here!|
The pond reminds me of the bubble bath I almost died in haha!|
Shape Gang woo!|
Wait, which team am I rooting for?|
If I fill myself with sewer water...|
I could shoot sewer bubbles!|
I think I'm going to faint!|
Wait, nevermind. That was just cold wind.|
Hm. I just wish I could remember...|
what I was wishing I could remember.|
Yay! You care about me, [PLAYER]!|
I almost forgot why I was here.|
But, then you sparked my memory with your nice words!|
Who are you again? Wait, [PLAYER] right?|
I remember! You let me fall in battle.|
I think I'm supposed to be mad at you.|
The town feels so empty without my kids running around and causing trouble!|
My kids would love it here!|
Maybe we should move in while you're gone haha.|
I don't think I've been over here before.|
Honestly, I didn't even know you could cross the pond!|
 I don't think it's safe for my kids to play here.|
My kids are a bit too young to be drinking apple juice...|
but I won't tell anyone.|
My kids love it here.|
When some of my kids come here, they never come back.|
I hope my kids never get eaten! That's horrible!|
So many new people! I want to introduce them to my kids!|
I used to love sailing back in the day.|
Maybe I'll teach my kids about it when they're older.|
Do you think I should take up fishing?|
I just don't think I would have the time.|
This mayor is pretty rich, huh?|
I wish we had a cool pond like this back at home.|
I don't think my kids are safe here.|
Careful not to get tetanus from all these rusty pipes, kids!|
Alright kids, some of you may die soon...|
but that is a risk I am willing to take.|
I hope my kids still think I'm a great dad.|
What a wonderful compliment! My kids and I are thankful.|
I've had a change of heart! Let's put my kids in danger again!|
I don't really want to talk to you right now.|
Don't talk to me or my kids ever again.|
Haha just kidding, we're just in immense pain!|
I would be a terrible dad to let my kids keep fighting.|
You haven't been the best role model for them.|
We're going to head out for now.|
I don't like my kids being in such a dangerous setting.|
We need to fight.|
Blugs only.|
Sorry.|
You seem confident.|
It's contagious.|
Now I feel confident.|
I'm going to leave now.|
Just die.|
Sorry. I didn't mean that.|
Blugs are cool. You are not.|
Sorry. That was mean.|
I wish I wasn't as insecure about my face.|
There. I said it.|
It be a lantern|
CALCULATE|
EMPTY|
I AM THE CAPTAIN.|
I WILL PROTECT SHIPMENT.|
THAT'S IT.|
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT NO MORE.|
I JUST WANT TO GO ON ADVENTURE WITH FRIENDS.|
JUST LIKE YOU.|
THANK YOU FOR BEING NICE TO ME.|
HERE, TAKE THESE PRESENTS.|
I'M GOING HOME.|
YOU LOOK YUMMY.|
I WANT TO EAT YOU.|
THE RAFFS PROMISED ME COOKIES.|
I LOVE COOKIES.|
YOU LOOK LIKE COOKIE.|
YOU CANNOT HURT ME.|
ONLY I CAN HURT ME.|
ALTHOUGH RAFFS SAY MEAN THINGS.|
THAT SOMETIMES HURT ME.|
I JUST WANT TO GO ON ADVENTURE.|
RAFFS SAY NO ADVENTURE.|
YOU SEEM LIKE GOOD ADVENTURER.|
THAT MUST BE FUN.|
It looks like my food has finally expired.|
Among other things it seems.|
I guess my meals just weren't good enough.|
I'm trying me best, you know.|
I've had my shop set up here for 31 years!|
I love this town.|
Mmm.. can I check your fridge for fresh ingredients?|
Haha just kidding.|
This is such a cozy area.|
Maybe I should set up a stand over here!|
Ah, the freshest water in town!|
I come down here for my special brews.|
Good ol' Toot's Tavern.|
I bet Toot and I could open an amazing restaurant.|
Maybe I should get a house in town.|
It would beat sleeping behind my food stand.|
Little do people know, I get some of the best ingredients out here.|
This place reminds me, [PLAYER]...|
You would love my Blug Soup!|
Mmmm... Blug Soup.|
It would be so nice to meet another chef or baker!|
I don't think I can swim, so we should be careful.|
Fish make a great addition to any meal.|
Mmm... I might take just one.|
I might raid the pantry before we leave.|
So much wildlife in that pond ready to be cooked and eaten!|
Hm, I always wondered what 3D food would taste like.|
You know one of my meals is Raff Pudding, right?|
I have all my meals prepared for this very moment.|
Thanks for being a great person, [PLAYER].|
You're always there for me, [PLAYER]. I appreciate that.|
Thanks for saying that.|
I'll make sure to whip up some amazing meals this time around!|
I've got nothing to say to you.|
I don't cook for bad friends.|
Everyone here loves us!|
We're superstars!|
Your house is so cool!|
We should write a song about it!|
I bet Ja would have loved to see this place.|
This place has some good reverb.|
Maybe Toot will let us play live here sometime!|
The acoustics in this place are pretty good!|
Hey band, this place is a no-no.|
I wonder if Blugs like music?|
I wonder if we have any competition here.|
We know a great pirate tune!|
Now is probably not the best time though.|
Do you think fish like music?|
I sure hope so!|
We could have done a grand fanfare for the mayor!|
Too bad they're dead.|
Life as a frog is the life for me.|
We should right a shape gang theme, fellas!|
I wonder if we can make music three-dimensional?|
I think we lost previous band members down in the sewers before.|
This cave will echo our music for eternity!|
We have the power of gods here! Haha!|
I feel a song coming on!|
Wait, no, I just have to pee.|
Was that meant for all of us, or just Vi?|
Yeah, he's the only one that can read.|
Either way, thanks!|
I'm not sure what that means, but we're hyped again!|
We're feeling extremely drained.|
Yeah, we might need a breather.|
Or maybe a nice compliment!|
Jo tripped and broke his trumpet.|
It was pretty funny, but we can't play now.|
Come on gang, we've got better places to be.|
I guess our music wasn't good enough for you, [PLAYER].|
You pet Milo the dog.|
Arrg, you'll never get to that shipment, landlubber.|
Wait, yeah I can. I'm a fish!|
I'm off to find some great friends!|
Thanks for the help!|
You can never kill me! I aspire to be so much more!|
Arrgg, that attack was a bit fishy.|
Hey, I get what you're trying to do.|
I don't think I can just leave Captain Chunk, though.|
Arg.|
You cast a line.|
I thought I saw a tug there! You should try again!|
You cast another line.|
Sadly, you find nothing.|
Keep trying, I know it's somewhere!|
Suddenly, your fishing pole is pulled into the water.|
Something flies out of the pond and lands in front of you...|
It's a severed hand!|
One of the fingers twitches.|
HAND added to inventory|
Being here just reminds me of Sarah.|
This home is cozy.|
I like it.|
Sarah and I used to love running around here.|
Is that my old hairbrush in the corner?|
Maybe EYE could be as funny as Crank one day.|
I don't know how I feel about this house.|
This place is scary.|
My eye should be able to spot plenty of danger here.|
I wonder if Sarah knew anyone here.|
Sarah and I used to love swimming together.|
Fish are ugly.|
I love them.|
I bet the mayor has so many pairs of shoes.|
This area is so calming.|
This is a nice little area.|
Running in the sewers can actually be quite relaxing.|
I bet I could beat the Snoodlewonker in a race.|
I wouldn't mind going for a run if we could move faster.|
I never receive compliments.|
Thank you [PLAYER].|
I'm sorry I was in a bad mood before.|
Your compliment has helped me feel better.|
Sarah never would have treated me like this.|
I don't need a giant eye to see how bad you mistreated me.|
I thought you'd treat me better than this, [PLAYER].|
I didn't think you could be this bad at being a friend.|
You see that floating button again? Each attack also has a button you need to press.|
For attacks though, the keys will be randomized every time.|
Go ahead and hit the right key there.|
Hey pal!|
Sorry, I can't let you get to that shipment.|
I've been doing a lot of thinking.|
I don't want to be a pirate anymore.|
My wife is going to murder me when she finds out...|
But who needs a wife when you have friendship!|
I didn't think I had too much to drink. This is crazy!|
This apple juice really has me dizzy!|
Or maybe it's how fast you are!|
Wow, I can still feel all of the hits!|
Now that's impressive.|
Wait, I think I'm about to pass out.|
Gosh, I'll never marry Botley if I'm dead.|
I've got a lot to think about.|
I haven't been called handsome once.|
What kind of bogus adventure is this?|
SKIP|
YOU ARE LOOKING QUITE * TODAY!|
IF I WOULD RATE YOU OUT OF 10...|
YOU WOULD BE A *!|
HEY CUTIE, ARE YOU AN *?|
I SURE WOULD LOVE TO TAKE YOU...|
TO * SOMETIME!|
WHENEVER I LOOK AT YOU, I *.|
I CAN SMELL THE * IN THE AIR!|
WOW, UP CLOSE I CAN REALLY SEE...|
YOUR *!|
WE SHOULD TOTALLY BE *!|
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU?|
I MUST BE A *, BECAUSE I'VE FALLEN FOR YOU.|
DO YOU BELIEVE IN * AT FIRST SIGHT?|
OR SHOULD I WALK PAST YOUR AGAIN?|
Ah, feels like home. So many beautiful faces here.|
The shed back there looks kind of run to hang in!|
Maybe we'll find some old magazines.|
I love all of the windows! Great for peeping out into the world!|
Get many hotties down here?|
Lenox is looking quite exquisite today!|
Don't you just love the feel of this house?|
I come here when I'm sad.|
Great vibes.|
Isla is quite the eye catcher!|
Do you think anyone here is single?|
The water reminds me of Botley's beautiful eyes.|
Oh, how I miss her.|
There's some cute fish in here.|
The mayor's wife is pretty cute, right?|
I think I can see my reflection in the water!|
What a handsome boy I am!|
I kind of just don't want to be here.|
I think the pipes are whispering my name!|
I'll leave my number just in case.|
Let's kick that Snoodlewonker's sweet butt!|
Not that I've looked it at more than five times or anything.|
Do you think romantic relationships are more important than friendships?|
Haha, I'm just messing with you. They could never be!|
That was the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me!|
Let's get back out there and find me love, er, I mean find Tortley!|
You don't really care about me, do you?|
I always want to be your wingman, but how can I if you let me fall?|
This will show you for being such a bad friend!|
I can't handle this anymore, you're just too cool to argue with.|
I'm leaving.|
Why couldn't you have just invited me!|
I was literally at your house!|
I would have given back your sword back anyways!|
You could have just asked.|
I hate how impressive that was!|
You know, I hope your adventure isn't that fun.|
I'm so sorry!|
Please just give me back my sword!|
Alright fine. Just take the stupid sword.|
I just want to go home.|
It's okay to cry Groncho, it's okay.|
Please don't make me fight you. I don't want any troubles!|
Ok, that was pretty cool.|
I still don't want to hurt you though! Please stop!|
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't impressed.|
But, please. Just give me the sword!|
Woah, wait, you actually solved the lever puzzle?|
Well, we won't let you get to that shipment.|
OR that lever behind us!|
Let's help out Captain Chunk, fellas!|
You know what? I don't think the pirate life is for me.|
Thank you for helping me realize that, friend.|
Just flip that lever behind me once you're done.|
It'll help you across.|
That did nothing to my bendy bones!|
Hah! Are you even trying?|
I really hope they're trying.|
That actually hurt me a bit.|
Only physically though. I'm feeling great mentally!|
You dare fight me? The king of all the Raffs?|
This will be quite the jollification.|
WAIT. STOP.|
I see everything so clearly now.|
What a monster I've been. What a terrible monster.|
I need you to understand, I never meant for any of this to go so far.|
You see, many years ago, this place used to be home to us Raffs.|
After outsiders began moving in, we left because we were scared.|
We're not used to people different from us.|
After I heard the port was opening, I arrived in a crate full of apple juice.|
I took as many Raffs with me as I could fit.|
We had to take back what was ours.|
Once we arrived, everyone was being so talkative with us.|
We had no choice but to hide away down here.|
What monsters those ground dwellers are.|
But, now I understand.|
They were trying to be our friends, just like you are now.|
I think us Raffs need to finally have a conversation with the townsfolk.|
We're not the best at friendship, but we can surely give it a shot.|
Thank you, adventurer. I'll always remember this day.|
I cannot believe you actually think you can win.|
Pathetic.|
Also, jollification means an enjoyable activity or celebration.|
You didn't react, so I wasn't sure if that was clear.|
You will suffer for your actions, both physically and emotionally.|
You have no idea how much pressure there is to be a king!|
You'll never understand.|
How are you happy in this world?|
How are any of us happy in this world?|
Family? Yeah, right.|
Love? Been there, done that.|
Friendship?|
Friendship...|
Well, this just became awkward.|
Dead Gwandma and I are out of here.|
You're making Dead Gwandma insecure.|
I think we might need to sit this one out.|
We should go hang out in my sewer hole!|
It's pretty nice down there.|
This is way better than my sewer!|
I wonder if my sewer connects to anything over here.|
Maybe the well?|
Ah, home!|
Doesn't that smell just make you feel nostalgic?|
Sometimes Toot comes to my sewer hole and gives me his leftovers.|
This is not my style of architecture.|
I don't think I've ever been to this part of town.|
This place smells like home.|
I wonder if they have a brand new sewer for me!|
I once knew a pirate who floated motionless down my sewer tunnel.|
I wonder how they're doing.|
Everything is too high off the ground for me to see.|
I would still take the sewers over this place.|
Not my style.|
Do you think Reginald has a bathroom?|
I really need to go and that pond is looking quite warm.|
Something is suspicious about this area.|
Now THIS is living!|
I love what they've done with the interior.|
Let's end this once and for all.|
I want to redeem myself for Morton.|
You're a good friend, [PLAYER].|
Almost as good as Dead Gwandma.|
What a kind thing to say for a ground dweller. Thank you!|
I appreciate that.|
Sorry if I came off as a bad friend.|
I'm feeling much better now!|
I bet the Raffs treat me better than you do.|
Heal me if you want me to be happy again.|
Stealing Isla's children was like taking candy from a baby!|
Except the candy was the baby. I think.|
This is confusing. Let's just fight.|
I didn't realize how talented you were!|
Wow, just take the kid. You deserve it.|
I'm off to practice more magic stuff.|
Shoot me an e-mail if you want to do this again.|
Do you really think you can defeat me?|
I can literally do magic.|
It's pretty rad.|
I made you do that.|
I'm controlling your mind right now.|
I really don't know how you did that.|
But, I'm still more talented.|
Okay, yeah that one stung a bit.|
But, like, in a good way.|
You're never going to save those kids!|
Okay, I can't lie anymore. You're just too cool.|
My eyes have really been opened.|
Don't let this adventurer scare you!|
They're nothing compared to us blugs.|
You're all just a bunch of dorks.|
Okay, that was actually pretty neat.|
Woah, how did you do that!?|
I- I mean. That was average.|
Where is Tom? What did you do with him?|
Huh, maybe Tom isn't a good friend after all.|
I put so much work into this party, and he didn't even show up.|
No one did.|
This party should be for someone who deserves it.|
Hey, I have an idea! Let's make it your birthday party!|
Yeah! Let's start this over.|
Just leave the room and come back in.|
Why are you ruining Tom's birthday party!?|
Please just leave! You weren't even invited!|
At least, I don't think you were?|
I sent a lot of invitations.|
Now that I'm thinking about it, no one really showed up.|
Huh.|
Why didn't anyone come?|
Is everyone really that bad of a friend?|
This can't be...|
But wait, you showed up!|
You must be a good friend!|
Hello|
There is not enough room to place Morton.|
DROP MORTON|
Guess I don't need you to move me anymore.|
This place is nice.|
I don't see any of my rock friends around here anymore.|
I am so old.|
Lloyd disgusts me.|
The tavern is probably my favorite part of the town.|
Toot should be so proud.|
This place sure does look familiar.|
This is where I first fought the Snoodlewonker.|
I have bad memories of this place.|
I don't think I've ever ventured this far past the forest.|
This town is a lot nicer than ours.|
Less boring too.|
You wouldn't think rocks could swim, but wait until you see me in action.|
Captain Googan looks awfully familiar.|
Another fellow with a great taste in art I see.|
Reginald, it has been too long my good friend.|
A group of shapes have nothing on me|
This reminds me too much of Lloyd's home.|
I hate it.|
This place is death.|
I'm too old for this.|
I may be old, but I sure as heck won't go out without a bang!|
Thank you.|
You're right.|
I just tightened up some bolts on my board. Let's do this.|
I'm giving you the stone shoulder.|
I'm just not ready to talk to you yet.|
Whelp, I'm too old for this fighting stuff.|
At least, you can never be too old for skateboarding.|
I may be able to break someone's bones.|
But, words do hurt.|
I am not sure how this ended up in the cave but I'm sure glad you found it.|
Phoney is out of here. I've got some calls to make.|
I thought I could trust you.|
Aye, I need a favor.|
This place holds some dark secrets.|
I sense something strange, yet comforting here.|
I love how secretive this area seems.|
Maybe I should live here instead.|
This is the best place to dispose of a body.|
Not that I would know.|
I think Skewer comes here a lot to wind down.|
This place has too much furniture for my liking.|
I know exactly how many people are buried out here.|
Even I don't have connections out here, so we better be careful.|
Hey, I think Not William Knot is around here!|
What a friendly guy.|
I'd probably make a great pirate.|
I'm really good at smuggling things.|
I sense a dark family secret here.|
Also, the smell of fish.|
I bet the mayor was into some shady stuff.|
I wonder if Reginald knows everything I have done.|
Ah yes, The Shape Gang.|
I've heard terrible things about them.|
I hope I don't get my wires dirty.|
The Snoodlewonker is actually a pretty nice person deep down.|
They were once human, you know.|
I've never actually killed anyone.|
Without the help of my friends, of course.|
Wow, I didn't think you actually cared about me.|
You know, you're actually pretty cool, [PLAYER].|
Look, I don't have time for your games.|
Heal me or leave me alone.|
I'm honestly trying to like you, but you're making it pretty hard.|
I'm just here for the party!|
You're going to make me late.|
Now I need to fight you.|
Alright, I'm out of here.|
I honestly just wanted some cake.|
But who needs cake when you have friendship!|
I doubt you were even invited to the party.|
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.|
You probably were invited.|
Literally everyone was.|
Alright chump, time to take care of ya.|
Oh my gosh. It's all so clear now.|
What an awful friend I've been to Tiny J-|
I mean Joey.|
Just Joey.|
I need to go find him. He deserves to be the true Joey.|
My real name is Jonny anyways. Thank you.|
I'm too cool for pain.|
I just want the King to be proud of me.|
Tiny Joey was a traitor. I have no regrets.|
Although, he was like a brother to me.|
He still shouldn't have tried to fight me though. Friends don't do that.|
Friends also look out for each other.|
I have't been doing the best job at that to be honest.|
Please lose some weight.|
You are definitely not rad.|
No one loves you, and no one ever will.|
You smell terrible today.|
Yikes. The view does not look good from down here.|
God, you are pathetic.|
A weakling like you should stands no chance against me.|
I have major daddy issues, so I'm taking them out on you.|
Why are you so greasy?|
I'm going to bully you to feel better about myself.|
You'll never be as cool as me.|
What a sad image you are to look at.|
Total dipstick right here.|
Wha- who are you?|
Whatever. It doesn't matter.|
You'll always regret the day you decided to fight Tiny Joey!|
Woah, you're a good fighter. You've really inspired me.|
I'm going to go fight Joey and take his place.|
I always hated the name TINY Joey anyways.|
You'll never be as cool as our King!|
Well, unless you do that.|
That was pretty cool.|
Hm, why does Joey always get to have grub with the King?|
Maybe I'm just overthinking...|
But, why do I always have to stand watch?|
What does Joey have that I don't?|
I'm a good Raff aren't I?|
Aye boys! We got company!|
Dang, you're a good fighter. You would make an amazing Raff.|
I can't wait to tell King Raff all about this!|
My arms and I deserve to be treated better than this.|
I may be strong, but I still have feelings.|
Everyone here is so nice to me even though I am new!|
Your furnace looks handmade to perfection!|
All of the little details make it so rad.|
I used to live somewhere secluded like this too.|
It's a good thing my arms float because I can't swim.|
Everyone is always scared to have a drink-off with me.|
Probably the arms.|
I never really get to see inside houses, so this is nice.|
I do not like this part of town. This is too much for me.|
I keep getting mud on my arms!|
Do you think anyone here is a blacksmith like me?|
I was once a pirate, you know.|
Those days of Rudy's life are long gone now.|
It's a good thing I don't have my big arms in here.|
I might accidentally crush a fish tank!|
I would have loved to meet this mayor.|
Maybe they were as nice as Tortley.|
I bet I could wield Reginald with some powerful weapons.|
He would never get attacked again!|
The Shape Gang is pretty notorious around these parts I hear.|
When we get back, I'm giving my arms a bath.|
It's time to make a name for myself as Rudy the Arm-nificent!|
Having a custom name is always intimidating.|
You know, my arms are actually made of metal.|
Freak accident, long story.|
Hooray! What a humbling compliment to receive!|
My arms and I thank you.|
Those kind words just changed my life.|
My arms and I are ready to fight again!|
Leave me and my arms out of this.|
You don't deserve to even look at my beefy arms right now.|
Evewyone in town knows my gwandma.|
I wondew how she is doing.|
Do you have any speciaw dwinks?|
The pwaygwound wooks fun!|
I'm pwobably too owd fow it though.|
I wondew if the watew tastes good.|
Gwandma used to come hewe a wot.|
Stiw not as big as Gwandma's house!|
This is way too scawy!|
I'm weady to kick some bwug butt!|
So many new faces!|
I wondew if Gwandma knew any.|
I wanted to be a piwate when I was a kid.|
I'm too smaw to see the fishes!|
Even this house is smawer than my gwandma's!|
Weginawd wooks wike my Gwandpa.|
I'm gwumpy.|
Waffs wook weawy yummy!|
I am weady to beat up this dumb Snoodlewonkew!|
I miss my gwandma.|
Thank you, fwiend. I wike you too.|
Wow! Sowy I was cwanky befowe.|
I'm weady to get back into action!|
No tawk me angwy.|
This has to be the wowst day of my wife.|
You awen't tweating me wight.|
I'm out of hewe.|
I huwt all ovew.|
This is youw fault.|
You came to the wrong part of town, kid!|
I don't think I want to do this anymore.|
Yeah, I was kinda thinking the same thing.|
I don't want to judge flat people anymore.|
They're actually pretty cool.|
Gunax lbh sbe eryrnfvat zr sebz guvf ragreany fhssrevat.|
Thanks for showing us a good time. See ya!|
If I wasn't so three dimensional, that would have hurt way more.|
You will never defeat the famous Shape Gang!|
Bu tbq vg uhegf fb zhpu raq zl fhssrevat.|
Hey, that move was actually pretty cool for a flat person!|
We should start rethinking our attitude towards this [PLAYER] fella.|
Cyrnfr whfg yrg zr qvr nyernql V qba'g jnag gb svtug.|
Hey. I got the stuff.|
We're going to be swimming in money after we take care of you!|
I just wanted to finally do something as a family.|
We've never gotten along, so I thought bounty hunting could be fun.|
I guess friendship is all I really wanted.|
Thanks for helping me realize that.|
Aye! I could use some backup.|
You'll never defeat my family.|
We're the best bounty hunters around these parts!|
You probably can't even snap your fingers like we can.|
That's embarrasing.|
You know, that kind of hurt.|
I'm not sure I want to keep fighting.|
Okay, we get it. You can fight.|
Can you just, like, die though?|
You can even fake it if you want.|
Ouch that really hurt! Please don't hurt my family!|
SAVE|
WAIT|
I am so sick of you.|
It's your fault I'm doing this.|
Ever since I met you, I knew I'd hate you.|
You don't know anything. You're so pathetic. You can't even talk.|
I've tried to be kind. I've tried to be friendly. You have left me no choice.|
You really thought I'd actually be your friend?|
You're not worthy of friendship.|
Honestly, you're a monster. You never listened to me.|
It's going to be so satisfying to watch you suffer.|
There's no point in running away. You're going to die no matter what.|
Did you really think you would make a good friend?|
You just stood there with that blank stare.|
You'll regret ever getting on that boat.|
This is our first battle so go easy on us!|
This is the best day of my life! I think I'm bleeding internally though.|
Oh jeez, please don't hurt us!|
Wow, that was actually really impressive!|
I'm learning so much for you!|
Arrgg, you'll never get to that shipment landlubber.|
I'm off to find some great friends! Thanks for the help!|
I don't think I can just leave Captain Chunk though.|
Hey pal! Sorry, I can't let you get to that shipment.|
You know what? I don't want to be a pirate anymore.|
but who needs a wife when you have friends!|
I won't let you get to that shipment.|
Let's help out Captain Chunk fellas!|
Tis just a scratch!|
I felt nothing!|
A few turns ago this was torture...|
but now I am really enjoying this!|
But, now I understand. They were trying to be our friends, just like you are now.|
Thank you adventurer. I'll always remember this day.|
You're never going to get those kids back!|
Wow, my eyes have really been opened.|
Good luck on finding Isla's kids.|
Let's stick it to ‘em fellas!|
You've gotten yourselves in quite the situation!|
That wasn't very cool of you to do.|
Isla is weak! Stealing her children was like taking candy from a baby!|
Dang, I didn't realize how fun you all were!|
Just take the kid. You deserve it.|
I'll heal you all right up don't worry about me!|
I wonder if I can heal myself. Probably should have tested that before.|
Maybe I should start healing you all instead of my own team.|
I am starting to rethink my actions.|
I'm just here for the party. I hope I'm not going to be late!|
Alright, I'm out of here. I just wanted some cake.|
But who needs cake, when you have friends!|
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. I wasn't invited either.|
Maybe, we should hang out sometime?|
Good thing the posters said DEAD or alive.|
You all are weak, simpleminded peasants!|
A human tongue. Rad!|
You eat the fucking apple.|
It's delicious.|
Not sure what you want to do with it. Maybe eat it?|
I was hoping you would protect my fluids.|
I'm going to sit this one out.|
Wow, and to think I gave you a free glass of water.|
I need some time to reflect on this.|
I hope Crank is taking good care of my tavern!|
If I stretch my legs, I would barely fit in here haha!|
Your house is stunning.|
I can't smell, but I know this place is pretty gross.|
Keep up the great work, Crank!|
I'm just happy to take a day off work, haha.|
I think I leaked myself a little.|
Don't worry, [PLAYER]. I will protect you from these foul creatures!|
I haven't seen a tavern around here.|
Maybe I can get them to come to Toot's Tavern!|
I get a good amount of pirates at my tavern, so no hard feelings from me.|
Captain, you are welcome at my tavern any time!|
I would have loved to serve the mayor a drink before they died.|
You can stop by my tavern anytime, Reginald!|
I am not sure if shapes can eat or drink, so I do not trust them.|
I hope we don't slip on anything gross or dead.|
I am ready for the worst!|
[PLAYER], I owe you so much.|
Thank you for everything you've done for us.|
Wow, [PLAYER], that was so nice of you to say!|
Drinks on the house when we get back!|
I was running quite low on fluids, but your kind words have filled me right back up!|
I'm feeling a little empty right now.|
I could use a nice compliment on my moustache.|
No one ever has anything nice to say about it.|
You try to open the umbrella but its metal stretchers are rusted in place.|
IS [PLAYER] HAPPY? [PLAYER] MUST BE HAPPY. DOES [PLAYER] WANT TO STAY? [PLAYER] NEEDS TO STAY. CAN I SURVIVE WITHOUT [PLAYER]? I CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT [PLAYER]. DO NOT LEAVE US.|
[PLAYER]? What's happening?|
No no no no something is wrong|
I CAN'T STOP IT|
