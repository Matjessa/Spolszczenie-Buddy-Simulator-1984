You're walking along a road. It's dark, trees almost entirely blocking out the sky.|
You're walking along a road. It's dark, trees almost entirely blocking out the stars.|
The oranges and browns of the leaves tremble as a wind blows through.|
Snow crunches beneath your feet. Your breath freezes your eyelashes.|
There's a heavy rain. The world looks like static.|
It's dry. The only water you've seen has been your own sweat.|
Some of them remind you of hands, waving.|
When you're not moving it's very quiet.|
Everything looks like it is moving.|
Bugs sing for each other, but not for you.|
You are alone.|
After walking for a long time, the road splits into two. Will you GO LEFT or GO RIGHT?|
REMINDER: Type HELP at any time for a list of commands.|
Pondering deeply on your choice, you start down the left road.|
It starts going downhill, you try to step carefully.|
You see ahead is a small speck of light.|
As you get closer you realize it's a LANTERN, hung on a tree.|
Moving onward, you eventually come to a wall. There are two tunnels cut into it, one LEFT and one RIGHT.|
You can see some light coming from the RIGHT tunnel. You see none on the LEFT.|
You start going left.|
You realize this was a bad idea. You can't see anything, it's too dark.|
You start shivering.|
Will you go back?|
You continue onward.|
You continue forward.|
You still see no light and the entrance is disappearing behind you.|
It's very very cold.|
It's now completely dark behind you.|
The LANTERN is flickering.|
You don't want to go any farther.|
This goes on for some time until you hear something strange and stop.|
You realize you aren't hearing only one pair of footsteps.|
There's something coming ahead of you, echoing off the walls.|
Your LANTERN goes out.|
You go back.|
You leave the left tunnel and feel relieved.|
You are now at the tunnel entrances.|
After going through the right tunnel, you emerge onto the front lawn of a HOUSE.|
You can see lights in the windows. It looks very nice and inviting.|
You can see a SHED, a PLAYGROUND, and a POND in the forest surrounding it.|
Back in the lawn, you can see a HOUSE, a SHED, a PLAYGROUND, and a POND in the forest.|
You collect yourself and start down the right path.|
It's slightly uphill. You walk for a while and start to get tired.|
You almost don't stop in time to notice a THING sticking out of the road in front of you.|
You're a bit too far away to see what it could be.|
You nervously approach the THING in the dark.|
Once you're close enough, you realize...|
it's a SHOVEL.|
You trudge your way farther down the road and are stopped by a large wall.|
There's a DOOR, and on either side, there are two stone skulls.|
One's toothless mouth is open in a large smile, and the other's empty sockets look into you.|
Will you USE your TEETH or your EYES?|
One by one, you pull out your teeth and put them in the skulls mouth.|
It feels nice to give.|
When you're done, the skull looks very happy.|
You can't help but smile.|
The DOOR opens.|
You look at the left skull and see how sad it looks.|
You pull out your eyes and give them to the skull.|
You can see yourself from them. You like what you see.|
After going through the door, you emerge onto the front lawn of a HOUSE.|
Stepping onto the porch, you feel a comforting calm wash over you.|
You are back at the house, you feel a familiar yet comforting calm wash over you.|
Above the DOOR there's a sign that reads, 'A HOME IS A HOUSE WITH A HEART'.|
A DOOR sits in front of you.|
If you were inside, everything would finally be okay.|
Planks creak as you step onto the dock.|
The WATER is dirty and hard to see through. Probably too filthy to drink.|
You wonder if there's anything beneath.|
Standing in front of the SHED, you see that the DOOR is sealed shut.|
Approaching the SHED, you see that the DOOR is slightly open already.|
The lock and chain that were around the handles are on the ground.|
You are now standing in front of the SHED. You can tell it's dark inside.|
You are now standing in front of the SHED. You can see a light flickering inside.|
There are no windows. It's hard to see.|
You feel around and find a THING and...|
You feel around and find...|
You feel around and find a THING.|
a SURPRISE.|
Light fills the tiny room.|
You can see a FISHING POLE leaning against the wall, a small CHEST in the far corner|
You can see a FISHING POLE leaning against the wall, and a TRAPDOOR in the floor.|
You can see a TRAPDOOR in the floor.|
and a TRAPDOOR in the floor.|
You can see a small CHEST in the far corner, and a TRAPDOOR in the floor.|
It swings open noisily, and the LADDER creaks as you descend.|
The subterranean room is dimly lit, but still too dark to see anything.|
The subterranean room is lit.|
Your lantern begins to flicker here.|
A pull CHAIN in the center of the room leads to an empty light socket.|
A pull CHAIN in the center of the room leads to a happily lit bulb.|
A pull CHAIN in the center of the room leads to a turned-off bulb.|
Reminder: Type LEAVE at any time to ascend back up the LADDER.|
Woodchips crunch under your feet as you step onto the playground.|
There's a SEESAW, a set of SWINGS, and a dirty SANDBOX.|
There is now a DOLL on each swing. One of them is ripped open.|
Sitting on one of the swings is a small DOLL.|
It looks lonely.|
You begin sinking into the floor and land into a seemingly endless abyss.|
Eerie, white figures float around in the distance.|
A small BOX with a KEYPAD sits in front of you.|
REMINDER: Type LEAVE to return to reality.|
The box is shaking.|
The box is no longer shaking.|
You try to take the small box with you, but it won't budge.|
You try prying it open, but there isn't a clear spot on it to begin prying from.|
As soon as your hand touches the box you feel an overwhelming sense of pain.|
Everything goes black.|
You wake up back in the front lawn with no memory of what happened.|
The KEYPAD is attached to the small box. Nothing special about it.|
You float upwards and emerge back into the [LOCATION].|
You are now using the KEYPAD. Reminder: Type LEAVE at any time to exit the keypad.|
Nothing happens.|
You are still using the KEYPAD.|
You hear a satisfying beep.|
Then a click.|
After stepping into the chamber, a light suddenly flickers on.|
Four mysterious figures stand in front of you.|
They stare at you.|
You feel awkward standing here.|
You should probably leave.|
You think to yourself how strange that was.|
You appear back in the front lawn.|
You take the lantern in your hand. You have light.|
It is hung by a hook nailed into the tree.|
Who knows who put this here for you? :)|
It is pitch black in this tunnel. You can feel coldness coming from it.|
You hate this tunnel.|
The tunnel is short, and opens into a field. You can see a house in the clearing.|
That must be where the light is coming from.|
You would continue, but it's too dark and cold.|
To go any farther like this would be a bad idea.|
You light the lantern and can now see.|
The tunnel is still very dark ahead.|
The walls look wet.|
It's tall and thin and looks like it's been shoved into the ground, so that you couldn't miss it.|
It's too dark to tell what it is from here, though.|
It takes a second to pull it out, but you eventually get it.|
The shovel clangs loudly against the door, but it's made of metal.|
Your ears hurt.|
The house looks brand new and much warmer than out here.|
You swear for a second there was something in the window, looking back at you.|
Dirt and silt cloud the water as you start to dig.|
You find nothing.|
You search for it in the muck and discover it's a key.|
You scoop up the water and take a sip.|
It tastes like mud.|
You bet there's clean water in the house.|
The moment your line hits the water, you feel a tremendous force pull it.|
Your FISHING POLE is ripped from your hands and into the water.|
Something flies out of the water and lands in your hands...|
It's a severed hand. One of the fingers twitches.|
You cast the line and wait. It's quiet for a very long time.|
Suddenly there's a very hard tug on the line.|
You quickly reel it in and find a key tied to the end.|
You wonder what pulled so hard. :)|
You take another look at the murky water then head to the [LOCATION].|
You make note of the shed and head over to the [LOCATION].|
After stepping on a few more woodchips, you head over to the [LOCATION].|
You step off the porch, make note, then head to the [LOCATION].|
You leave the back of the house, then head over to the [LOCATION].|
You make note of the keypad, then head to the [LOCATION].|
Dropping it to the ground, the hand scurries away.|
You don't see where it goes.|
A familiar HAND suddenly leaps into your inventory.|
It was carrying something...|
It shows you how to get to a HIDDEN PLACE.|
You get it in your hands and realize it's a fishing pole.|
You put your hand out in the dark and feel around.|
Suddenly a sharp pain rips through your skin.|
You pull it back and look to see what happened.|
It looks like the numbers [CODE] were carved into your ARM.|
Taking it in your hands, the chest feels oddly light.|
You can feel something moving around inside.|
The lid creaks as you open it. It seems very old.|
Inside is a small cloth DOLL, in a blue outfit.|
It's missing an eye.|
If only you had more to give.|
You follow the chain to the ceiling. A bulb now sits in the socket.|
You follow the chain to the ceiling and see there's no light bulb in the socket.|
As you take the key into your hand and pull, it comes free.|
A click sounds as the chain is pulled. The trapdoor swings shut.|
Your lantern flickers off. It is now totally dark in the room.|
It is now totally dark in the room.|
A soft noise fills the space from somewhere near the walls...|
It sounds like nails tapping.|
You suddenly feel hands all over you, rifling around. You try to push them away, but they're strong.|
The door swings back open, and the room is lit again.|
There is nothing.|
You check your pockets.|
You discover a hand drawn picture of an [ANIMAL].|
You like it.|
The bulb squeaks as you screw it into the socket the CHAIN is attached to.|
Some dust flakes off of it and gets into your toothless mouth.|
Some dust flakes off of it and gets into your mouth.|
A click sounds as the chain is pulled. Light fills the room.|
There are many faint scratches on the wall. They look like tallies.|
A wall covered in a [COLOR] liquid suddenly begins to slide open.|
After a few moments, a secret room reveals itself.|
You can clearly make out an old CABINET and a large pile of BONES.|
There also sits a strange DRAWING on a wall and a glass CASE.|
Something shiny catches your eye socket in the glass CASE.|
Something shiny catches your eye in the glass CASE.|
The glass CASE is now empty.|
Two small, circular slots are engraved on the front of it.|
Upon further investigation, you notice two ring-shaped slots on the front of it.|
The case is now empty.|
The case is now open, leaving the KEY inside exposed.|
You also get a glimpse of a shiny KEY behind the glass.|
You try breaking the glass with your fist, but this doesn't accomplish anything.|
The glass CASE is already opened.|
You cannot get to the KEY. The glass CASE is still sealed shut.|
You take the KEY from the case.|
You already took the KEY.|
After walking closer, you can now see that the DRAWING is painted on the wall in [COLOR] goo.|
It looks like a depiction of a long, serpent-like creature bearing innumerable spikes.|
The DRAWING is painted on the wall.|
You cannot take it.|
You press your hand on the drawing in hopes of something to happen.|
The only thing this accomplishes is [COLOR]-stained hands.|
After stepping back, you realize how pointless of an idea that was.|
Suddenly, your entire body is frozen.|
You are paralyzed with fear as the drawing seems to come to life and speak to you.|
If you want to leave with your life, answer my riddle.|
You can have me, but cannot hold me.|
Gain me and quickly lose me.|
If treated with care I can be great|
And if betrayed, I will break.|
What am I?|
trust|
I'll give you a hint!|
It's something I hope we can always have during our friendship!|
It starts with a 't' and has 'us' in it!|
Still having trouble?|
All you have to do is TRUST me haha!|
An audible click is heard on the old CABINET.|
You are no longer frozen.|
Incorrect. Guess again.|
The bones are so old and brittle.|
Whoever this was must have died long ago. The cause of death was probably not fun at all.|
You notice something shiny in the pile of BONES.|
You try and take some of the bones with you when a skeletal hand drops down on your fleshy hand.|
You don't think it wants you to take its bones.|
You notice an interesting looking RING on one of its fingers.|
You take it.|
You politely move aside a femur, skull, and pelvis in order to find a skeletal hand.|
It shakes your hand like a familiar friend.|
It just sits there.|
It must be mad at you.|
You take the RING off the skeletal hand.|
The skeletal hand has no more rings to take.|
You cannot take the old CABINET because you aren't strong enough.|
Plus, where would you put it?|
There are three drawers, two of which are completely broken and twisted.|
The last one seems to be locked.|
The last one seems to be unlocked.|
You try opening all of the cabinet drawers, but they all seem to be damaged or locked.|
You open the last functional drawer only to find a singular RING.|
You open the last functional drawer only to find nothing.|
You walk over to the glass CASE and place the RING into the first slot.|
You place the RING into the second slot.|
The ceiling of the glass CASE pops open, revealing the KEY inside.|
Approaching the seesaw, it doesn't look like anyone's used it for years.|
You imagine a ghostly child sitting on the other side,|
waiting countless days for someone to come play with them.|
You feel tears in the corners of your eyes.|
You feel tears in the corners of your eye sockets.|
You take a seat on the seesaw.|
You try to push it down with all of your weight, but it's stuck in place.|
As it goes down with your weight, you hear a distant click.|
You get off the seesaw.|
A light illuminates from the shed.|
One seat is taken. You take the other one.|
You would, but both seats are taken.|
Chains screech as you begin swinging.|
Just as you begin to get high you look to the doll and stop.|
Its head is now turned towards you.|
You get off the swing. It's not fun anymore.|
You begin moving around the muck of the sandbox and try to make a castle.|
You just get sad that it's not as good as the house.|
As you dig, you feel something.|
You pull it out and shake off the muck.|
It's a BULB. Who would play with this?|
You try, but as you tug, you realize the doll's hands are somehow stuck to the chains.|
You leave it alone.|
Digging deep into the contents of the sandbox, you begin shoveling.|
Eventually, something shiny catches your eye.|
Eventually, something shiny catches your eye sockets.|
It's a bulb!|
You dig and dig and dig until the contents of the sandbox are almost empty.|
After a while you get tired, and realize it's starting to feel like a grave.|
You get out.|
You place your doll on the swing next to the other.|
For a moment, nothing happens.|
Then nothing happens.|
You begin to, but once your back is to the dolls,|
you feel something hit the back of your head.|
You turn and see the doll's chest has been ripped open, stuffing exposed.|
On the ground behind you is a key.|
Must be a thank you.|
As you leave the playground,|
you hear the sound of swings creaking and children laughing behind you.|
You smile.|
that was fast|
Feeling so silly you didn't see it before, you notice there's a second lock!|
For sure.|
Guess it'll take just a little longer to get inside.|
hehe.|
Whoops! haha! You didn't see the chain that wraps around the door, which has a lock too.|
You feel like this should be the last one.|
Probably.|
The door clicks.|
It's unlocked.|
Everything is dark...|
Please come back [PLAYER].|
Promise you'll come b-|
WAIT. How did you?|
Actually nevermind! Haha I don't want to spoil anything.|
Just pretend I didn't say anything.|
No. You cannot eat the hand.|
It won't let go of you.|
It is lit.|
It is not lit.|
It's in good condition.|
It smells like mud.|
It is eagerly twitching.|
It calmly holds onto you.|
It's an old fishing pole.|
It's wearing a pretty blue dress.|
It's a simple key.|
It's got some sand on it, but it should still work.|
There doesn't seem to be a lock. It's not very big either.|
It's a picture of an [ANIMAL]. You happily notice the name [ANIMAL NAME] scribbled on the back.|
You can still make out the numbers [CODE] etched into your skin.|
There is nothing to look at.|
You can't see anywhere to go.|
You can see...|
where am i|
You don't know where you are.|
You are at the [LOCATION].|
In your inventory you have...|
You have nothing in your inventory.|
y o u c a n t|
It's too dark to see anything.|
It's just a tree.|
You don't want to go back down that tunnel.|
It's best you leave it on.|
The walls still look wet.|
You are too far from it. Try moving closer.|
You can't. The door is locked.|
It is locked.|
Nothing happens. The door is stuck open.|
It's already closed.|
It looks happy.|
It looks sad.|
You can tell it's locked.|
The door is now open.|
There is no need. The door is open.|
You already used your teeth.|
You already used your eyes.|
A murky pond sloshes quietly behind the house. You can see a small dock is there, too.|
Drab and tiny, the shed looks like it's been here much longer than the house.|
A pair of swings sway gently next to an old seesaw. That's all you make out from here.|
You can't see much from here. The back of the house is covered in plant life.|
You are already here.|
The handle shimmies but doesn't open. You have to find a way inside.|
The handle shimmies but doesn't open. It's locked.|
It's a simple door but you sense warmth.|
You push open the door.|
It's too dark and scummy to see through.|
The door is slightly opened. Who opened it? :)|
You enter the shed.|
Reminder: Type LEAVE to leave the shed at any time.|
You can't. The door is sealed shut.|
You are back outside the shed. The door is still opened.|
You should leave the shed first.|
It's too dark to tell what it is.|
You are back outside the shed. The door is now locked shut.|
I t s g o n e|
Cobwebs cover it, but there doesn't seem to be a lock. It's not very big either.|
It'a an old fishing pole. You can tell it's been here for a while.|
Long grooves line the boards at the mouth of the door. Maybe someone dragged something down there?|
There is no need. The shed light is already on.|
You open the chest. It is empty.|
The only way you can go is UP the LADDER.|
You ascend back up the LADDER.|
It's just a basic ladder.|
You pull the chain, but nothing happens.|
The bulb is already screwed into the socket.|
It's just a dirty box of sand. The sand looks damp.|
They look fun.|
They aren't fun.|
It looks fun.|
It isn't fun.|
It looks like it hasn't been played with in years.|
It is patiently sitting in the swing as if it's waiting for someone.|
Its head is still looking towards the swing you used.|
The dolls are calmly staring forward.|
One of the dolls sits with its chest ripped open.|
You don't want to play on the seesaw anymore. It's no fun by yourself.|
You don't like swings anymore.|
You don't want to play in the sandbox anymore. It will just make you sad.|
The numbers have been replaced with the letters: F U N.|
It has three slots where numbers can be changed.|
There is no need. The BOX is already unlocked.|
You are no longer using the KEYPAD.|
Invalid response.|
Command is invalid.|
I don't know the action '[INPUT]'.|
